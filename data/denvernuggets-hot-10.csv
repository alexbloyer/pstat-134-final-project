mrfsvng,chinadonkey,"Yeah I wasn't criticizing your doctor specifically, they just generally tend to have limited advice when it comes to that stuff. I've worked with some physicians over the years who focus on the importance of nutrition and exercise within their specialties, and they have a lot of education initiatives to raise awareness among a broader group of physicians. A patient with prostate cancer is going to have a lot better outcomes if they are also working on their heart health, for example. I saw a talk about how all of the research shows that caloric reduction resulting in weight loss is the healthiest approach to eating, rather than focusing on what type of foods you eat.

On the flip side. Okc is a great team, probably the best team in the playoffs right now. They’re deep, they get to the line, they play fast.
