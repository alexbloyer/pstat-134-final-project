mn6we0u,SongBig1162,"I have Fleming above Newell but that’s because I don’t think Newell can shoot (although watching Fleming throw bricks into the ocean the final 4.5 games there’s some definite question marks on his shooting still). But the thing about Fleming is that he suffers from the fact that he’s slow (not physically but in terms of quickly he processes information on the court). He’ll hesitate on moving the ball around on offense or he’ll be slow to rotate at times on defense. If Fleming was like an 18 or 19 year old this wouldn’t be that big of deal but he’s 21 and a 3rd year in college. It’s the whole reason why Jonathan Kuminga struggles with the Warriors.

mn6svu6,Arr0wmanc3r,"Rasheed Wallace is currently 50 years old. (To be clear, the above comment was edited since it started out saying ""Rasheer Wallace"". Just a lighthearted retort on my part.)

Edit: Snark aside, I assume you're talking about Rasheer Fleming. I think a lot of the +s for Asa are about his body and how he moves it - he's pretty agile for a probably 6'10"" guy and has great explosivity off the floor. Rasheer is a guy who does it more in the interior with his strength, and keep in mind that he's a Junior playing in college, guys in the NBA will be stronger and make that way harder. Obviously Fleming's other big positive is his shooting, which is way ahead of Asa. I think most indications point to him becoming a solid but not elite shooter, which combined with his size and defense makes a very obvious case for his floor to be the ever useful 3 and D forward archetype. The thing with Asa though is that his physical attributes are something that point to a higher ceiling - and teams, especially rebuilding ones, often like to go for the high ceiling guys in case they become Giannis v2.",4,126865.0,1744694989.0,ripcity

Only thing I'd add is you're not comparing apples to apples with Asa and Rasheer. If you compared them as freshmen or even at the same age (Rasheer is pretty young for a Jr) then Asa pretty clearly comes out on top. 


I think Rasheer has elite role player potential, if his processing improves. Asa is more of a question mark but there are pretty high level outcomes if he shoots it or gets a little better in PnRs. ",5,6201.0,1744697528.0,ripcity

It was, and IMO should still be, seen as a positive move from the trailblazers organization. Hart was on an expiring contract as an UFA (at least I think I remember it being unrestricted ) and almost definitely was not going to stick around in free agency. 

Essentially we got two bench players who both got playing time for the rest of that (lost) season, a late first round draft pick that we turned into a player who is currently a deep rotation player and has the potential (albeit the potential is shrinking instead of growing) to be an NBA rotation player, and a player widely seen as one of the best wing defenders in the NBA. 

What we gave up was a player almost certainly leaving in the off-season in free agency, a 2027 second round pick, a 2029 second round pick, and we had to drop ""Bouncin"" Greg Brown III",7,11124.0,1746723325.0,ripcity

I really like Hart, but also REALLY like Matisse, dude came back and looked like he had never even missed any time lol. D and 3P shooting were amazing right out of the gate. I like Murray too, especially more on the defensive side. Like Jabari Walker, he does a lot of little things well that doesn't show in his stats. If both of those 2 could get even to like 34ish% consistently it would really raise their value as role players. Walker shot 39% this year but super low volume.

But seriously, we have a bright future with an explosive core of young talent - especially Sharpe, Advija, Camara, Scoot, and Clingan. Simons may be on the trading block, but regardless he is also a very potent offensive threat. Tossing in Thybulle, Ayton, Blanton, and Grant only makes the salad better. Banton and Murray are also great contributors off the bench as was demonstrated in the last half of this season.

Coach Billups just had his current contract picked up for his fifth year option as well as a new contract for a guaranteed two years. Blazers fans vacillate wildly with a love/hate relationship with Chauncey Billups, but he's a great players coach and has done an admirable job this season with improved playmaking and rotations.

The Blazers front office and team in general projects a really healthy, happy culture. Our GM Joe Cronin has done a helluva job in getting the most out of trades and team assets. It was hard for Blazers fans to see Lillard being traded to Milwaukee but it freed up both parties to pursue sunnier pastures. Simons may be next to be traded - a literal protege of Lillard - and that will also be hard but Cronin will get the best value to help this young team build for the future. Cronin is a proven winner.

We have one of the best front offices in the league. We have amazing broadcasters both on TV and on radio. We have one of the best and most rabid fan bases in the NBA here in Rip City, and we're hungry to start winning again after several tanking seasons.

The best part? We have the [second youngest team in the NBA](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/por/sort/age/dir/desc/portland-trail-blazers) and they've already started to gel as a unit. The Thunder are the youngest team in the league and just won 68 games. We won 36 games which blew away the Vegas odds of between 21-25 predicted wins. We saw tantalizing glimpses of the potential this team has in the second half of this season: athletic, defensive-minded, and deeply talented. 

The future looks bright. It's a great time to jump on the Blazers bandwagon because our trajectory is finally aiming up...hopefully as high as this young man's unreal vertical.

>Think of Deni as a Luka who started out on very hard mode and decided to put more points into defense instead of offense.

>Shaedon Sharpe is exciting and waiting to break out.  His max ceiling is Michael Jordan, simply because he can just as high as Jordan (Kobe/Wade/SGA/Harden could not), his interior FG% is probably the highest in the NBA for a guard, and his mid-range FG% is almost the same as MJ....

>....*But* reality is that he is not likely to become MJ since his defense is subpar and he plays passively at times but that could just make him the T-Mac of the era or something.  

>Ideally, he hits 24-25ppg next season.

>Clingan is the Blazers version of Lively

********************************

>Similar to 2011, 1977 is Blazers championship year and holds a special spot.

***************************************************

>Portland has A LOT of ""What ifs""

>Could've had Michael Jordan but drafted Bowie.....also skipped out on Larry Bird, Dr. J, KD, and Moses Malone (the last one being drafted and traded away by Portland).  Basically, that's five Top 20 EVER guys that they skipped out on.  I don't know if any other team could say that.

>But it's not like Portland didn't draft great players, either.  If MVP Bill Walton was healthy, they probably win a few more rings.  If Arvydas Sabonis came into the NBA earlier, they probably win a few rings.  If Roy-Oden-Aldridge stayed healthy, they probably win a few rings.

>On top of that, Portland also has long histories of winning seasons on par with the Lakers, Celtics, and Spurs.  Thus, if Portland had that first ballot Hall of Fame superstar on top of those winning seasons, chances are likely they win rings like those franchises did.  So, yeah, good product out of Portland but bad luck.
