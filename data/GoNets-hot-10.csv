WTW:

1. I think we draft 3 Rookies. Our Lotto Pick, The Bucks Pick, and The 2nder.

The Knicks and Rockets picks will be used to move into the 2026 draft class (The Nuggets doesn't have any picks in this class, those could be a trade partner)

  
2. I think it will be all of the above, They will use the cap to pick up a salary dump for assets, placeholder contracts (Dlo) & a Longterm contract (Picking up a FA that will be here post rebuild. Probably Nickeil Alexander-Walker)

  
3. Im predicting Cam will get a 3 year descending contract anywhere between $18-25Ms, Dayron ($5.9) and Ziaire ($8.3) will both get their Qualifying Offer.

  
4. Im 50-50 on both guys. If they do get traded I think Claxton will either be a Laker or Hawk and Cam will be a Spurs.",3,28078.0,1744671420.0,GoNets

mrefbg4,starstruckdemon,"Not a nets fan, but the last few days of news and PR from Nets FO sounds more and more like they’re ready (and posturing) as a well run organisation to land the top draft pick (that is if you still believe the league tampers with draft lottery odds). It’s not going to any of the teams from the already-stacked West conference, leaving Wizards, Philly, Charlotte, Brooklyn and Toronto. Considering Brooklyn’s solid now in player development, roster construction, draft assets, and still in search for their franchise guy, who else to look forward to other than the 6’9 phenom born 400 miles up north in Maine. They’re not gonna send him to Wizards with Sarr, Philly with Embiid and PG, Charlotte with two franchise guys in Lamelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Toronto might be the closest to Nets in terms of how competitive and developmental the teams were and the potential fit of Flagg and Scottie is intriguing, but my gut strongly leans on the league doing the right thing and sending Flagg to a team that can develop the guy and give him the keys. You think Wemby landed on Spurs purely based on the ping pongs? Either way we can confidently expect the Nets to land a top 3 pick but I’m more confident they might get their guy after all. If a consensus number 1 pick is soon to enter the draft, expect the league to intervene and influence the lottery for protecting the landscape of the league and expect that to be a non franchise star and non-mismanaged org/team (likely Toronto/Brooklyn)",1,8716.0,1746789049.0,GoNets

They like to say that on the radio, but go on social media, their Subreddit, talk to them in real life, and they sure don't act like they don't care.

However I don't hate the Nets. It's my 3rd favorite team. I would support the Nets in almost every circumstance except if they are facing the Knicks. Unlike some Knicks fans, I like both NY teams.",1,297448.0,1746727605.0,GoNets

Its not just the Knicks, A good portion of them are also Sixers fans, It's odd. Its like they have no hometown pride. Obviously, the Nets are no longer a NJ team, but when they were, they could never get the support from the residents.",1,28078.0,1746737124.0,GoNets

Prior to Linsanity, I just followed players but I did count Jason Kidd among my favorite players. However I never considered myself a Nets fan. I was a Jason Kidd fan. Maybe that is because I was an immigrant. I didn't have a sort of state/city pride until Linsanity.",1,297448.0,1746737599.0,GoNets
