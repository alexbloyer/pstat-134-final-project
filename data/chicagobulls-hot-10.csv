mquqppg,ahmed_a20,"The Giddey contract situation is very interesting and I’m a lot more torn on it than I had originally thought I would be. A few months ago I would’ve refused to even consider resigning him, then by the end of the season I was happy to have him stay for no more than 25 mil a year over 3 or 4 years. But after thinking about it more I can agree to some extent with the people that believe he should be getting 30+ million a year. But it all depends on context.

Giddey is not a guy that will be a top 10 player in the NBA, neither will he be of the two or maybe even 3 most important players on a championship or contending team. But he definitely will be an elite supporting cast guy or role player in that scenario. With that in mind, if the Bulls somehow want to compete immediately and trade for guys like Zion or Gianni’s and bring in Myles Turner in FA, Giddey shouldn’t be receiving anymore than like 22 million a year, because he won’t be at the top of the list of most crucial players in that case and it would give the bulls more flexibility to make the necessary moves to improve the roster to compete. If he’s serious about winning, he would accept.

Now if the Bulls are finally going to accept who they are and just bottom out for a few years, Giddey can get paid whatever the hell it is he wants for however long the bulls plan on tanking. Because in this scenario Giddey is arguably the most important player on the team, at least for the first two season of the tank, or until we get a top draft pick that conveys into a generational talent. By the time the bulls builds this young team of top draft prospects to a point of playoff and even championship contention, you can then revisit Giddey’s contract and cut it down to accommodate for all the other people on the team.",0,25942.0,1746521189.0,chicagobulls

mre5nge,forgottenhero71,"Giddey is 22, his first 2 years were promising at OKC, 3rd year was poor. As a 21year old he had to go to work everyday with boos and being called a pedo. His personality seems to be softly spoken nice guy/ softish white guy….. remember when you were 21, how would you go if every day you went to work you were abused?

How would you go if you had 10,000 co workers abusing you? Taking the human side here I am giving him a pass as post January have seen someone who cares, wants to be here, wants to prove people wrong, he doesn’t like losing and most importantly I saw someone that wants to improve on defence.

Look he was injured the last month, liked his competitive spirit against Lakers, Denver who were trying to win. Miami’s coach is just quality…clamp down Coby main outlet for Bulls to score. Giddey has one arm be physical hurt him.1st quarter defence poor but I thought 25 points working away when your best shooter has been taken out I was a bit surprised…

His defence in Nov, Dec really had me questioning the trade but his effort was pretty good post Jan. Really hope we trade up to get Queen or the Duke big man as we need defence and young players to grow together. Main thing I like is Giddey knows his weaknesses and seems to be committed to try and improve. I also think Chicago made the trade not believing that Lonzo would make it back. Giddey thought he was PG, Coby and Ayo didn’t want to give PG up.

I think we need to talk to the Hornets around what incremental improvements they will give us in FRP or pick swaps in a Lonzo trade for that expiring Suns offcast (expiring).

Giddey is not a franchise player.

Giddey is not a no 1 option 

But he is a table setter,  elite defensive rebounder, elite passer, high iq, improved defender but needs to continue to work. If we get him for $28m for 4 years he’s not perfect but it is one of the few AK deals where history will prove them right.

After initially not hating the trade but being concerned about mental health issues, he was way better than my expectations, and he’s a bit different… a lot of the other guys aren’t ready/expecting the passes…happy to see the Coby/Giddey /Buz experiment to the trade deadline at least then make changes need in FA2026.",1,0.0,1746783832.0,chicagobulls

mqugz5v,A1Horizon,"True, but they weren’t tanking for 17 years. After the Billups/Hamilton/Wallace era they pivoted to TMac and Ben Gordon which didn’t work, they entered a small rebuild which got them Monroe, Knight, Drummond and KCP. 

They then immediately tried to accelerate the rebuild by bringing in Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings (if they properly rebuilt they might’ve ended up in a better position)

But they kept building on that and finally ended up in the playoffs with Reggie Jackson, Drummond and Tobias Harris. That team was built to be mediocre, then they continued to hover around the 8th - 10th seed for the next few years (sound familiar?) even after trading for Blake Griffin.

Only after they actually started a proper tank, with some painful basketball and terrible draft luck outside of 2021 I’ll admit, did they end up in a playoff position that looks sustainable. So yeah they went 17 years without a playoff win, but that’s really their own fault because they didn’t start a proper rebuild until the last 5",3,153731.0,1746514856.0,chicagobulls

Plus since Vooch is on an expiring deal they can try one more run next season with him to see if it works and if not that's around the time most of their core are coming off their contracts so they can just let everyone retire or walk and restart a rebuild with the few young guys they have.

The bigger issue is that the NBA doesn't punish pure obvious tank jobs. When the Jazz were sitting healthy players for weeks at a time and they get slapped with a fine that likely was less than the money they made on ticket sales you know the league is just pretending to care about tanking. Silver should have said ""actually try or we're taking your picks."" 

I also doubt the revenue they bring in for one extra game matters at all. This whole line of thinking just comes off like a conspiracy thinking. The reality is a lot simpler. The Bulls are like all the other teams that end up in the middle all the time. They don't have the assets to make a major move but they also are simply too good to lose all the time. Given the roster they left the ASB with the fact they ended up 9th is sort of crazy.

Go to any sub for any team deep in a tank. Their game threads have like 12 people who stop posting by halftime. 

Yes a tank is smart teambuilding, but the thing that makes the current Bulls different from OKC, the Cavs, the Magic, and the Rockets is that they had high-level stars that teams were willing to give up multiple assets for to get. OKC didn't just tank, they tanked after trading Russ and PG. The Rockets traded Russ and Harden for picks. The Magic had Vooch and Aaron Gordon. The Cavs are about the only team that just lost guys and had to rebuild from scratch and it took nearly a decade and again, they didn't draft Donovan or Allen or Strus. 

At best trading Vooch and Zo gets us zero return.
