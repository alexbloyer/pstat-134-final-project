The coin flip occurs when teams finish the season with the same record. The league does a coin flip to determine who gets the more favorable pick.

All I’ve been able to find online is that it happens “a few days after the end of the regular season.” Anyone know when it is?

mn1wq5w,IamOlderthanMe,"It all depends on the draft lottery.

Whether we can have hope this offseason in progressive moves or we wallow in misery for another season, it all depends on the draft lottery.

- Cooper
- Dylan
- VJ

We can make deck chair moves like moving our expirings for underwhelming prospects, but if we hit big in the lottery, our franchise's fate changes forever.

Some of the deck chair moves that I would like:

- Betting on underwhelming prospects. 

Jaime Jacquez Jr has been in the Heat doghouse for multiple reasons, rumored to be dogging Spo's ex wife. There is a small, small chance that the Heat may be open to trading him. I believe he is the connecting player that we need on the wing. His 3PT issues can be solved in our 3PT healthy system.

Jonathan Kuminga. A lot of problems and will be extremely expensive. But the Dubs obviously are not prioritizing him for their stretch run for Steph's final hurrah. Perhaps we can get him for cheap (but he will be expensive to pay). I personally do not like this idea fully because of how expensive he would be.

Patrick Williams. One of the most underwhelming prospects in the league that is being overpaid. But we can get him for Nurkic expiring and a SRP or two. Could be valuable in a new system.

- Moving on from Miles Bridges and Mark Williams

Miles is our healthiest player. Besides LaMelo and Brandon, Miles has the most trade value. He is on a team friendly deal and he has not done anything terribly abhorrent in a year. Yes, he is a terrible person, but a team can trade for him and obtain great value. We could then shore up that spot with a draft pick or a veteran role player that is cheaper.

Mark Williams' problems have been aired out by Rob Pelinka and the Lakers crew. Mark is beloved here, but because of his health issues, trading him may be the best option. Mark showcased his health toward the end of the season. Maybe some team will bite. Otherwise, I dont mind keeping Mark for another year and showcasing his skills for another prospect of a trade.",-3,984994.0,1744634676.0,CharlotteHornets

mn3i7tu,a_moniker,"It’s a bit tough because most players who are as raw as Salaün aren’t actually given NBA minutes until later in their career. Their minutes also vary wildly, so I’ll use per 36 numbers and effective field goal percentages in order to try to standardize them a bit more accurately. 

**Here is Salaün’s per 36 minute stats:**

- 10.2/8.1/2.1 per 36 on 41.4 eFG% over 60 games

**Here are some other good to great players with bad rookie seasons:**

- Jimmy Butler averaged 10.9/5.6/1.4 per 36 on 41.8 eFG% over 42 games
- Dirk Notwizki averaged 14.5/6.1/1.8 per 36 on 42.6 eFG% percent shooting over 47 games
- Giannis averaged 10.0/6.4/2.8 per 36 on 46.3 eFG% over 77 games
- Jordan Poole averaged 14.2/3.3/3.8 per 36 on 40.6 eFG% over 57 games
- Jonathan Isaac averaged 9.7/6.6/1.2 per 36 on 43.5 eFG% over 27 games
- Pascal Siakam averaged 9.6/7.8/0.7 per 36 on 50.5 eFG% over 55 games
- Aaron Gordon averaged 11.0/7.6/1.5 per 36 on 47.8 eFG% over 47 games

Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head, which is why it skews more towards star level players despite the fact that Salaün is almost certainly not gonna reach that level. I’m certain there are a bunch of worse rookies that turned into decent rotation guys that I just can’t think of right now. Of course, it’s also important to keep in mind that a lot of those names listed above came into the league older and more experienced than Salaün. 

Overall, Salaün’s play this season definitely wasn’t promising, but it also doesn’t mean he has no hope of becoming a solid player. Of the names listed above, Jonathan Isaac is probably the most comparable player/archetype that, personally, comes to mind.

I'm not saying the dude is going to turn into Giannis, but Giannis' rookie season wasn't good and people were also questioning that pick as well. All we need is for Salaun to just not be a liability.

We've been taking on bad contracts in exchange for draft picks, have been trying out different G-Leaguers all season instead of sticking with known bad players which has already lead to one success story and a half (Moussa & Baugh), we've made no stupid short-term win-now moves like we were accustomed to in the past (e.g. the Hayward contract), and they've already announced that they'll be making a bunch of investments including building a new practice facility which was long overdue.

These are the kind of moves smart teams make, and is a huge step up from the MJ years where we were selling draft picks for cash. Our roster is still pretty horrible so I don't expect any miracles for next season, but I'm quite hopeful that we'll turn this around in due time if they keep this up. The results haven't been there so far, but I'm quite pleased with the process, and in the end that's the only thing you can control.

mn4l5xg,Giddf,"You can't extrapolate per 36 stats and efg% for dudes that played their rookie years in completely different eras, styles of play, different roles, and different amounts of opportunity. And use that as a point of comparison.

Jimmy Butler averaged 8mpg his rookie year. His per 36 stats are meaningless. Poole is a small guard. Dirk played his rookie year over 25 years ago when the style of play and level of offensive efficiency was completely different. You are right in that Jonathan Isaac is the best comparison to Tidjane on this list but you leave off the fact that Isaac had a 3 times higher steal rate and a over 4 times higher block rate than Salaun. Which clearly sets him apart.

If you want to standardize stats you don't use per 36 either. You use per poss. To normalize for pace. And TS% is a greater indicator for someones scoring efficiency because it accounts for fts drawn+made whereas efg% doesn't.

Tidjanes closest comparisons in my opinion are Sekou Doumbouya, Kevin Knox, and Poku. All taller off-ball forwards/bigs that have similar shot diets. All received around 20mpg+ their rookie years in a solid sample of games. And all played in the same modern era of space and pace basketball. They have the same below average efficiency from both 2pters and 3pters. Well below 50% TS. Similar ft rates. Low point production. Low or unspectacular stock production. 3/4 of them including Salaun have an ast% below 10. And all of them have a higher tov% than ast%. All of them except for Knox have lower usage rates (<20%) as well. With Tidjane having the lowest usage rate of the four. The only statistical category he ranks in the best of these 4 players is his rebounding. But hes also not meaningfully ahead enough for it to be a special trait of his.",1,17718.0,1744664510.0,CharlotteHornets

mr5pj78,devinbookersuncle,"We could easily trade for booker with accumulated draft picks and a couple of guys as contract filler.

Booker can veto a trade but the suns are also completely trash from top to bottom and our reputation has gone up some since the lakers were shown to be the problem in the Mark Williams trade.

We've already been linked to Giannis and as long as Booker gets paid I really don't think he cares too much where he's playing so long as that team isn't completely dysfunctional which is really only a couple of organizations, Washington being the biggest offender along with the Kings.  

My username may be a joke on who Luka spanked Devin in the playoffs and ""sonned"" him but the guy is legit one of the best teammates in the league (as per how he played in the Olympics in giving up his ego to do what was best for the team and we need more guys like that here) along with offensively being one of the best scorers in the league and that isn't even subjective.  Pairing him next to Melo would make us a legit playoff team when healthy and Devin can bridge the gap between himself and Melo because he's only 28 so he still is within our timeline.  I wouldn't want to give up Miller for him necessarily but I also know what kind of player Booker is and I'd give up alot for him honestly so long as we get some good role players for help fill out the roster.",1,20977.0,1746661760.0,CharlotteHornets

Booker + Miller won't be enough to keep us afloat with our abysmal bench. I'd much rather draft Cooper or Harper and watch the pieces fall into place and make a decision next year. At this point nobody except for Brandon should be untouchable.",0,10801.0,1746736020.0,CharlotteHornets
