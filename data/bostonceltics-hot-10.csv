mrdti8u,PeterDinkleberg,"People are justified to be upset. At the end of the day, we match up well and usually play great against these Knicks. 4-0 in the regular season and 4-1 last season. On top of that, it seems like our ECF matchup would be Indiana or an extremely injured Cavs team. On paper it looks like we have a great chance to make the finals and try to repeat. So to see our team blow a 20 point 4th quarter lead two games in a row, and our superstar melts down both games... it's infuriating

At the same time I think that we can easily turn this around. We haven't played great ball or shot well and we've been holding big leads late into these games.

The disappointing thing for me about Tatum is that I could actively see that he listened to all of the criticism from last game about the 3s. For the most part I believe he‚Äôs done a great job tuning out the criticism but this is the first time in the NBA I could see it so clearly. He was turning down shots I‚Äôve seen him take all season which you can‚Äôt do because they just sit on your drives. Honestly wouldn‚Äôt be mad if he came out next game and put up a bunch of 3s. I don‚Äôt care if you miss if it‚Äôs the right read. If they‚Äôre playing drop shoot it. Just eliminate the step back unless you got it going and I‚Äôm good. 

Also I don‚Äôt think he should be matched up on KAT at all. I think having to box out the other team‚Äôs center is hard and he‚Äôs the leading rebounder on the team. Seems insignificant but not having the advantage of leaking out to get yourself some easy buckets on transition makes things tough and you‚Äôre running the full length of the court every possession which can take away your legs for shooting.

How do you not call timeouts when needed? How is your last play of the game to hope a semi transition bucket works again? I see Kerr setup actions to get his guys open and it feels like we need more of that from Joe and haven‚Äôt gotten it. We drove more in the second game but are scared to attack still because of NY semi help. They need to be decisive and make plays like we have all season.

McBride waking up is a big problem for Boston. We have a very weak bench so getting big play from Mitch/McBride is huge for the Knicks.

JT shot under 40% overall - there is no way a Finals MVP will have that statistic.  I'm not sure if Steph shot under 40 the year Iggy took it, but when a guy has 1 or 2 bad games in at most a 7 game series, they aren't taking the Russel trophy.

JB needs to recognize his own weaknesses and avoid them.  His dribble drive turnovers are getting very cringe.  It's no secret to just do a quick double on him and the ball is gone.  I call this a lead by example type behavior.  Players **aren't** going to listen to him, if he sets bad examples himself.

JT/JB have never seemed to be that ""it"" go to guy that so many other NBA stars seem to be.  It doesn't mean those ""it"" guys have anything close to 100% success rate.  But you can see it, they want the ball, they want to put on their move and they have confidence.  JT/JB last second shot is always some low percentage, off balance shot that we pray goes in.
