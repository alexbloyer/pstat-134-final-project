Honestly props to Haliburton.   

It was incredibly smart for him to drive for the 2 when the Pacers were down 3.

Almost every other player would've looked for the 3.

He went for the 2, got free throws, missed the second free throw intentionally, got his own rebound and made the game winning 3.

But OKC is smart enough to know there‚Äôs really nothing you can do to stop jokic‚Äôs offense. He‚Äôs going to impact the game on that end regardless. Focusing all your time on trying to stop his offense is kinda pointless. So OKC just said ‚Äúalright, we‚Äôre going to make him unplayable on the other end.‚Äù 

Jokic guarding a big? Screen him onto a guard. Wide open shot. Jokic guarding a guard? Screen guard to guard, and again a wide open shot. Denver goes zone? Screen the action into jokic‚Äôs area and force him to close out on a guard. Again a wide open shot. Jokic plays the elbow? Just pull the big out and run cuts. Again wide open layups. All game long OKC attacked Jokic into oblivion and it resulted in like a 70% shooting, largely uncontested easy offensive half of basketball for them. I really can‚Äôt think of a single way Denver can possibly overcome this, because they *have* to play Jokic. They can‚Äôt just bench him, that‚Äôs silly.

Denver‚Äôs prayer going forward is either extremely hot shooting on the offensive end, or extremely cold shooting on wide open 3s by OKC on the other end.

mrex8wo,pufffsullivan,"Think about this for real for a second because adding their accolades later in their career is useless.

That team was not a good 3pt shooting team, their spacing was quite poor. Perkins would be useless against ihart and Chet, any pick and roll action involving him would be an auto bucket.

Harden was an awful defender. The heat hunted him relentlessly and he would be abused by the shai, JDub, Wiggins, Caruso, and Wallace. He would also struggle so hard offensively against pretty much all of the current wing players.

The way the current team defends pick and roll would be difficult for Ibaka and Collison. Neither were great ball handlers and a 17ft jump shot isn‚Äôt too helpful when the opposition has multiple 38+% 3pt shooters.

The game is way different now that it was 13 years ago. I love that team quite a bit but the defensive depth, 3 pt shooting, and versatile bigs would beat that 2012 team in a 7 game series.

Joker may be the best player in the world on the court but as a leader im taking Shai 10/10 times.
