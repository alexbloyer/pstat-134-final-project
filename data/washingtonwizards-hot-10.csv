Gil is a dumbass, but I don't actually think he pushes peoples buttons for any real malicious reason other than him trying to keep things light and enjoyable. He seems to regret the gun locker room incident, but also interesting to learn he kept a collection and was constantly buying on the road during his playing days for his collection.

One thing I thought that was by far the stupidest part of Javaris' story; dude said he wanted to be home, around his people; friends and family etc - understandable, especially after things not working out in the NBA, cool. He understood his town in Georgia was not a good place and the projects were dangerous. Why the fuck are you walking around iced out, in nice clothes with a nice car, and staying strapped?

Like bro you know what the streets are. You wanna be there for the support, you know showing off in an area like that is gonna draw attention. I'll give you a pass on the first robbery, but the second robbery? You didn't make any adjustments to your lifestyle aside from staying strapped? Your whole thing was you needed protection after being robbed as a rookie so you joined the crips. You were psychologically suffering after losing so much in your career. You get robbed again, not once, but twice?! The cops tried to help but you didn't want to snitch and escalate things yourself with 'street justice'?

Fucking idiot bro. Should never have been in that dumbass situation if you just stopped showing off. Don't need to be strapped if you got nothing to get robbed over. Don't need to be investigating the crime if you identify the perp and let the police deal. Don't need to be in Atlanta if you knew how to deal with adversity and worked your way into coaches trust and rotations.",1,1362.0,1746757098.0,washingtonwizards

Couple thoughts…

A lot of people make comments that Gilbert came off as a bigger asshole than the actual murderer but i fall on the other side. Crittenton seems like the guy with an excuse for everything. Something about the workout story where he got accused of stealing sandals really stuck out to me. I get that whatever happened probably got overblown but after everything with the gun charge why are you even putting yourself in that position at a workout where you’re trying to salvage your career? 

Also, the movie leads you to believe that the locker room gun incident led Crit down the wrong path and if it hadn’t happened all of the tragic events years later may have been avoided. Maybe. But Crittenton was an active member of the crips as an NBA player. He also got a drug charge while out on bond and never seemed to leave the hood behind. I have a hard time thinking he wasn’t always bound to do something really fucked up.

Finally…i get you had to have Arenas as the movie’s headliner in order to market it but this was really a doc about Crit’s life. There’s like a 15-minute period in the movie where we don’t see or hear from Arenas at all. The most poingant moments were the words of Crit & Julian Jones’ mother. 

Also, being that Arenas & Crittenton have seemingly patched things up it was surprising there were no current day scenes of the two together or even a joint interview.",0,45236.0,1746769831.0,washingtonwizards

mrazxik,KigaroGasoline,"Flagg and Harper would clearly go 1/2.  After that, Ace Bailey is the prototype Dawkins pick. He is oversized for his position, is versatile on defense and he can dribble, pass, and shoot. Plus he is young and fits the mold of “needs patience”.   If he is available 3-6 when the wiz pick, I have a hard time seeing them pick anyone else.  However, I don’t think he is the prototype pick for every other GM, so he might actually still be available at 5 or 6.",8,4751.0,1746735239.0,washingtonwizards

During the draft itself right before we took him, pacers were already receiving calls from both Presti at OKC and Danny Ainge with the jazz looking to move up for a trade for Bilal. Had we not taken him first he was going to go to one of 2 of the best GMs in the league.
