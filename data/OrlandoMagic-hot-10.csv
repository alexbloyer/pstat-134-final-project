mpezmxr,warp10barrier,"Hey, at least the Lakers are down 3-1 too lol

Let‚Äôs be real, this wasn‚Äôt unexpected, we know what‚Äôs wrong with this team and we know the playoffs highlight that. No one realistically thought we were going to win this series so I went into it with zero expectations, and (aside from the obligatorily putrid offense at times) I honestly don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve played all that badly. They‚Äôve fought hard and put up a pretty damn decent effort all 4 games, and I‚Äôm happy they could get that game 3 win. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter if you hate Boston or not they‚Äôre the defending champs, and as much as everyone here doesn‚Äôt wanna admit it, they have a pretty damn good team. But over the last couple years we‚Äôve seen that we have 2 VERY YOUNG stars who are already capable of carrying us for a game here or there if called upon to do so. Yes they sometimes have bad games, but they‚Äôre being asked to put the entire team on their backs every‚Ä¶ single‚Ä¶ fucking‚Ä¶ night. It‚Äôs not sustainable to ask them to carry that kind of load night in and night out. And if you can get off your goddamn ass and build an offensively-competent roster around that, you can win a LOT of games. They‚Äôre so young and still years away from their prime and if you can take some of the pressure off of them, maybe they can start to blossom to their full potential. You also have two solid pieces in Suggs and Mo that aren‚Äôt even contributing right now. It‚Äôs a good base to start from, but they absolutely *must* begin to make significant moves to start down that path. A roster construction that is this offensively anemic is never ever going to work in the NBA in 2025.

With Franz staying back complaining & getting pissy it left us down a man on D which allowed Boston to capitalize on offense. Franz needs to work on keeping his cool, dudes body language didn't hide the fact he was crazy frustrated for the majority of last night, I get it, but Boston smelt that blood in the water.

Gary (surprise) and Caleb were brutal last night. KCP finally decided to hit a couple of 3's. Coach Mos' lineups boggle my mind sometimes. He leaves cold players in too long or doesn't adequately call a TO when the Magic lose momentum or Boston goes on a run. Crazy annoying at times.

Overall, I wasn't expecting a Magic upset this series. The Celtics are the defending champs and they play like it. In order to steal another game we play a near flawless game, disrupt on D, make open shots and HIT OUR FUCKIN' FREE THROWS. The refs ensure we don't make it to the line at anywhere near the same frequency as Boston, so we have to do better than shoot 70% from the line. Those 6 misses are unacceptable.

Our stars were gassed because Mose over played them and generally anyone not names Franz or Paolo doesn‚Äôt take the impetus to take shots or push the ball except in tiny sample sizes. Players like AB need to get the ball and stop deferring to the stars even when they miss. I feel when players not the big two and miss they don‚Äôt want to take more shots. So as annoying as Caleb was missing those shots at least he had the guts to take them.  

Ultimately this is still a very young team and we are missing two major players. Suggs is a huge miss KCP has been an unmitigated disaster Harris useless and WCJ too inconsistent. 

Some issues like I mentioned including shooting hopefully will improve with some players as they get experience and others with personnel changes. This team currently ain‚Äôt it. But pretending this year wasn‚Äôt massively derailed by injuries is kinda dumb too. More than one thing can be true and we lost a lot of time this team needed to grow and gel together by the stop start nature of all the injuries. 

Hopefully we can take another game or two but honestly it‚Äôs moot because if you aren‚Äôt in it to win it you‚Äôre just selling playoff tshirts. This team has zero chance at winning it all. 

All that said Suggs, Paolo, Franz, and imo AB all look like a solid group to grow into even better players. Hopefully we make moves and maybe draft a gem or two in this packed draft class.

mpf1718,BleedGreen4Boston,"The roster construction is a little odd to me.

I don‚Äôt understand why they extended Wendell. There‚Äôs probably some untapped upside but I doubt he realizes it playing with Paolo and Franz. When Mo was healthy they seemed to have serviceable centers along with Goga. 

I would have thought they try to use his salary and maybe a Jett or Houstan and picks for a starting PG. 

Maybe they are just waiting around for AB to blow, but the coach certainly isn‚Äôt treating the situation that way.  Cole helps tremendously with Mo out to give them bench scoring but depending on how things shake out you probably don‚Äôt need both of those guys in the rotation. 

A Suggs-AB backcourt with Paolo-Franz playing half of the 5-4 minutes next to a better shooting wing than KCP apparently and a serviceable center to allow them to go 4-3 like they do now is probably a more realistic outcome than trading for a star PG because I just don‚Äôt see anyone out there that makes sense.

You guys match up really well with us. You can tell how much the defense gives our guys trouble, especially if you take away the perimeter shooting and disrupt the passing lanes.  

One of the most glaring problems I saw with the Magic, which is true for any team, especially in the playoffs is that you can't have 2 guys trying to do it all offensively. Banchero and Franz are obvious studs but I'm impressed with the supporting cast, at least defensively.  I haven't watched that many Magic games this year, maybe ~15 ish, but idk what happened to KCP and why's he's taken this downward turn.  

I honestly don't think the Celtics squad was ready for the physicality coming into the series and I think it's a good thing for them to face, should we advance from the first round, I think it will force them to be tougher.

Myles Turner is the #1 option. He does everything WCJ does but better. Might be pricey, but I'd rather pay him 30 mil this season than KCP and Harris another 30 mil combined. 

A little undersized but a much better shooter, Naz Reid could become a free agent this summer if he chooses to. 

Brook Lopez is expected to hit FA this season. Not a long term solution, but I think would be a good starting option, with a strong center rotation behind him that we currently have.

I wish we had put more money towards Hartenstein last summer instead of KCP but that's old news. 

Anyway, those are the options I see realistically for this coming FA. There's also always the option to trade for one, but Im not sure if you were genuinely asking, or wanting to make a point?

WCJ had poor OFFENSIVE advanced stats last year. 54 % TS for a big is rough. Think Goga finished with 63 TS in comparison. Because he is simply smarter. 

He is trying to space the floor, but no one guards him anyway. Tho in reality he provides the same spacing as Goga. But Goga actually cleaning up misses better and getting better positioning on offense. And finishes with a better TS %.

centers have to be at least good at 1 thing on offense

- offensive rebounding (you get your offense more shots -> likely higher ORtg)
- rim rolling for lobs (gravity)
- space the floor (shooting)
- or have such good post moves that you can score in the post on your own

you could make the argument WCJ did nothing of those things really well on a consistent basis.

Its to the point, where you might look at the draft, and get someone like Sorber, if you think he can be a future starter in this league.

Tho you draft a guard and a big in the draft. And before people say you need Vets. Vets make 10 times more money, you wont be able to afford players. 90 % of the franchises having (future) problems with the (2nd) apron, and have to get rid of players, because costs explode.

WCJ is without a doubt the most underrated player on our team. When he‚Äôs healthy he‚Äôs an insanely valuable defender. If you don‚Äôt believe me look at where his defensive EPM ranks, which is a much better metric than PER.

Issue is he has a hard time staying healthy, and he can be incredibly frustrating even when he is healthy.

The other thread praising him said one positive thing‚Ä¶he‚Äôs good at switching. Wow‚Ä¶thank god we have a center who‚Äôs good at switching. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôd rather have a center who can score, shoot the three, rebound, and defend/block shots. Ya know critical things you want your center to be good at.
