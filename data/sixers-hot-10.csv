mrfkkzb,clickstops,"I'm only 2/3 through it but it's hard not to appreciate Daryl's candor in yesterday's RTRS interview. I can't imagine listening to it and coming away thinking ""man, that guy sucks!"" Though I'm sure someone will tell me their opinion otherwise.

Some thoughts on it so far -

* Joel clearly only wants to be an MVP caliber player or not play. Feast or famine, I guess. No role player, back seat Joel.
* Certainly seems like we're going to sign Grimes. Daryl seems quite confident in the Maxey / Grimes back court. 
* Maxey / McCain backcourt seems less on the menu than anticipated. That part of the interview also brought into question his confidence in Joel's health, since he talked about how it's hard to run that backcourt, and is unlikely, but it would be possible with Embiid.

Gotta say, Maxey Grimes back court with McCain getting 25mpg sounds really, really nice, regardless of what else happens.",10,247025,1746803848.0,sixers

mrfkh4v,XxStormySoraxX,"I really don’t love the idea of Morey pointing to Kawhi as a successful scenario for Embiid’s recovery. Kawhi is much smaller than Embiid, and also had a lot less responsibility on the Clippers than Embiid will have on the 76ers. Kawhi also only played 31 games this year and we only got to see him in 1 playoff series this year, we have no clue if he would have held up for the rest of the playoffs had they advanced. Overall I hope Embiid can come back to his MVP self but if the best case scenario is “Kawhi” that doesn’t give me much hope.",3,78996,1746803816.0,sixers

I think Embiid is willing to take on less offensive responsibility if he trusts his teammates to handle that load, like he did with Jimmy.

Yeah that was one of the biggest takeaways I had there as well. My guess is he probably thinks Jrue or KP is headed to the Nets this offseason and Nets will look to facilitate trades over FA offers.

mrfrx7z,Niceguydan8,"> I really don’t love the idea of Morey pointing to Kawhi as a successful scenario for Embiid’s recovery.

The Clippers are also just built better to function without Kawhi, and I think a lot of that has to do with how their salary is spread out across more (and generally better) players. I think what last year showed me (I basically stopped watching this team entirely when the they started actively tanking)is that *current* Maxey and PG just doesn't get the floor where it needs to be. I'm not saying they cannot get there this coming season. But last season they were clearly just not good enough individually.

Contrast that with the Clippers, where Harden + Norm + Zu was clearly a good enough core(that also fit and play really well with one another) where the floor was still reasonably high while Kawhi was recovering.

Maxey + PG make ~84m combined. 

Harden + Norm + Zu make ~66m combined. 

The difference between those two numbers(~18m) is very close to the salary amounts of DJJ, Batum, and Kris Dunn *combined.* Those are all fairly high quality role players that can consistently contribute to success in the regular season.

I really do think Embiid + PG + Maxey all on maxes (Maxey's being less because of his tenure) will be really hard to make work for a ""Kawhi"" recovery because the team is so top heavy compared to the Clippers, who really aren't.",10,483301,1746806072.0,sixers

Problem is, that half decent offer needs to return a 3&D wing that can give you 15 points, bc our wing/forward depth is atrocious w/o PG. 

We've been starved for wings for years, so I'm just not in a rush to get rid of ours that was an all-star in '24.

Is the goal to win a title or is it to make the players feel good? Answer to this will tell you what type of fan you are. 

This isn’t even a debate to me. You don’t pay for past performance. There was zero reason to extend him coming off major knee surgery. Let’s not forget, the meniscus surgery he had often times alters a players career for the worse. 

It’s not like Embiid is some guy on his rookie deal waiting for his big payday. He already made 300M. Sure he’s been through a lot, but that doesn’t mean the Sixers should ruin their future to apologize.

But really, this isn’t on Embiid. It’s on Morey, absolutely incompetent move by him. He either had no clue Embiid was injured or he knew he was injured and still extended him. Should be fired for that.",8,150619,1746747160.0,sixers

Celtics are cancer because fans of the other 29 teams all hate them and everyone hates and has been affected in some way by cancer.

Knicks are AIDS, because everyone talked about it/them in the 80's and early 90's but not as much recently because of bad management/preventative drugs.",15,19886,1746671149.0,sixers

When everybody is clicking on both ends of the floor, it’s just great basketball to watch. So I am super happy for our Nova boys.

Also, I am loving the fact that this modern era of over-reliance on the 3 point shot is getting exposed in these playoffs. Especially teams like the Celtics and Twolves who love to spam it to death. It’s just not a fun brand of basketball to watch and really removes the strategic aspect and other different skill sets on the offensive side you can use.

The Celtics, while I truly hate them (even more), has already won a chip recently so them at least winning this series then losing to the Pacers or Cavs would be more ideal.

I’m *comparatively* apathetic to the Celtics fanbase. Spare jrue holiday, i dislike the Celtics org. They probably have the least excuses of any team in the league to face plant as embarrassingly as they did to the heat in ‘23. If I were driven by the worst part of me, I would have an Al Horford voodoo doll. If this same knicks team were in any other city, I’d probably feel about them the way I feel about the cavs or something, or that year when the kings were good.
