mrfuuno,w000dsyOwl,"For the Greek Freak I’m making that deal in a heartbeat. I think the Bucks would actually want more and not accept this offer. 

Rim running centers without a 3 point game are easy to find in the draft. Ivey is a great story sure but hasn’t shown enough to be a long term investment. Tobias is in there to help match the salaries. Punting on Ron Holland this early in his career would be tough to swallow if he reaches stardom but there needs to be value for the Bucks to give up their franchise guy. 

Look at the trade between the Jazz and Cavs for Mitchell as a guideline for a trade like this. Cavs had a guy with Garland and just drafted Mobley. Traded for Mitchell to build around a core 3 of players. Also stole Jarrett Allen from the Nets for a 1st round pick that wasn’t theirs originally. Pistons could eventually be a #1 seed just like the Cavs this season if they were to add a star like Giannis to pair around Cade and Ausar plus role players. The next move would be for a rim protecting center. 

Here are the details of the Cavs/Jazz trade 

Cavaliers receive:
Donovan Mitchell

Jazz receive:
Collin Sexton
Lauri Markkanen
Ochai Agbaji
2025 first-round pick
2026 pick swap
2027 first-round pick
2028 pick swap
2029 first-round pick

I think there would be a bunch of pick swaps added to your originally package for Giannis like this trade.

mr74spb,organic,"I started watching this season after not having watched much basketball in 20 years, and after you get past the initial shock of all the flopping going on, the game really is much more interesting strategy-wise.  So many more offensive and defensive games going on, so much more shot variety, some very good defensive play happening.  

The only thing that still really bugs me still is the way offensive players are encouraged to launch themselves at defensive players who are ""out of position"" in order to ~~bait fouls~~ draw contact.  Seems more dangerous to me than the physical defensive play of the 90s and 00s era.",5,57129.0,1746681828.0,DetroitPistons
