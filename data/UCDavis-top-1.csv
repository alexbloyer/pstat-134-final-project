mm5rzdk,slim_1111,"The United States cannot serve as the world’s escape hatch. It’s a straightforward reality that seems lost on too many: every nation on Earth has immigration laws for a reason. Borders exist to manage who enters and stays, ensuring stability, security, and economic balance. When someone is told to leave—whether due to expired visas, illegal entry, or failed asylum claims—it’s not a suggestion; it’s the law. Ignoring that doesn’t make it any less true.

Much of the current mess stems from the Biden administration’s reckless policies. Take the CBP One app, for instance—a tool that’s effectively waved millions across the border with little vetting or long-term planning. Since 2021, illegal border crossings have spiked, with estimates from U.S. Customs and Border Protection showing over 7 million encounters at the southwest border alone. That’s not a manageable influx; it’s a flood. The administration sold a promise of compassion, but what’s compassionate about letting people in only to leave them in limbo—facing deportation, legal battles, or worse—when the system inevitably can’t sustain them?

And it’s not sustainable. The U.S. isn’t an endless well of resources. Housing shortages are worsening, wages stagnate for low-skilled workers as labor supply balloons, and taxpayers foot the bill for healthcare, education, and welfare programs stretched thin. A 2023 study from the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimated the net cost of illegal immigration at $150 billion annually after accounting for taxes paid by undocumented immigrants. That’s a burden no country can shoulder indefinitely. The idea that we can just absorb everyone who wants a better life sounds noble, but it collapses under the weight of reality.

I genuinely sympathize with those caught in this chaos. Many crossed deserts or risked their lives chasing a dream, only to find themselves pawns in a political game. They’re not the villains here. The real fault lies with the previous administration’s open-door experiment—inviting millions in without a plan, then acting surprised when the house of cards falls. Deportation isn’t cruelty; it’s the consequence of a broken policy. The law demands enforcement, and fairness demands accountability from the leaders who created this mess. They have to go back, not because we lack empathy, but because the alternative is a system that collapses on everyone—citizens and immigrants alike.",-5,750.0,1744172946.0,t3_1jugfrt,t3_1jugfrt,/r/UCDavis/comments/1jugfrt/my_prof_got_his_visa_revoked_over_the_weekend/mm5rzdk/,False,,False

mm6a5fo,fred_p112,"I think you fail to mention the stigma that immigration carries, and I strongly believe it stems from xenophobia. You’re correct in saying that there are laws in place that hold illegal immigrants accountable, but regardless of this, we still owe them due process. This administration is failing to uphold that right—one granted by our own history and the amendments to the Constitution.

Biden’s administration, although not the greatest in its process, still believed people should come here for the American dream that everyone hears about. I think we should welcome those willing to put in the effort—which most are—especially given the fact that a large majority work in construction and agriculture for embarrassingly minuscule pay. They helped build this land into what it is today, and yet we blame them for economic imbalance? There’s more blame to place on corporate greed than on illegal immigrants.

Trump’s administration used scare tactics and hate to fuel the antagonizing behavior some people already carried. He gave them a voice to spit racial slurs with confidence and no fear of consequence. It’s disgusting that anyone would defend this behavior solely based on immigration policy.

Who says the system can’t sustain them? In fact, I believe we choose not to sustain them—just like we fail to increase the minimum wage for American citizens. Do you really think people deserve to be paid $7.25 an hour in this country? I know that’s not really your point, but illegal immigrants get paid even less. How do you expect them to contribute positively to a system that exploits their labor?

You say you sympathize and that you don’t lack empathy, but that’s kind of hard to believe considering you chose to judge these people instead of helping them—or at least seeing their perspective. Nobody who comes here plots the destruction of this country in advance. They come looking for life. Some even come trying to escape danger. Even though the previous administration didn’t have a well-thought-out plan, why stop and force these people back, interrupting the lives they’ve already established? I’m fully aware that this country doesn’t owe anyone anything, but why do we claim to be empathetic if we don’t use empathy when we need it most?",2,176.0,1744182984.0,t1_mm5rzdk,t3_1jugfrt,/r/UCDavis/comments/1jugfrt/my_prof_got_his_visa_revoked_over_the_weekend/mm6a5fo/,False,,False

mm9itms,No_Brilliant6061,"So here's the thing, a contract is only as good as the two people who make it, and the ones who interpret and enforce it. At the highest form of government the supreme court interprets, and the executive branch makes, with the help of congress and senate and sometimes without their help, and the executive branch also enforces it.

The 14 amendment has been interpreted the same way for 150 years, and to change the definition of citizenship to the opposite is to repeal the supposed citizenship of anyone since the 14 th amendment.

Except its worse than that. If you read the executive order on birthright citizenship carefully, at first glance it suggests that it only affects citizenship for those born in the U.S. 30 days after the order. But when you start allowing loopholes, for example using a comma to change the entire definition of the 14th amendment, you can change the supposed interpretation of that executive order.

Specifically, Section 1 that defines citizenship, is dependent on the citizenship of previous generations, with no timeline for where it ends.

Section 2 refers to acceptance of already issued documentation listing citizenship, with sub b, or c? giving a timeline for section 2, but not a. 

So all they have to do is say your great great great great grand pappy and grandmother weren't citizens, and then they go through the lists and all the spouses, and boom, sure enough no one is a citizen. At least for anyone that was naturalized far enough back.

But that's what happens when one of the people making the contract isn't only interested in the mutually beneficial interests, but in squeezing out whatever they can get from it. It's like having a landlord constantly trying to increase your rent and make you pay for things you never agreed to in the first place.

mm691z9,Nutarama,"Depends on employment.

The China model employed in Hong Kong basically believes that if people are working and using their days off to protest (like on weekends) then making examples of leaders and injuring many will get most of the protesters to stay home next time. They have a choice between a decent life with a job or doing years in prison and getting out labeled a felon.  Most people will choose the decent life.

The camps tend to get implemented when employment is low. Like in Northern Ireland the unemployment rate routinely went over 20%, which meant a bunch of people with no jobs looking for anything to do with their time. The IRA then recruits them to go do something and can offer food and a shared house if they get evicted.

Now we can go over to what the administration has said about what they’re doing with those programs from the horses mouth:

“The Trump Administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits. President Trump himself has said it (over and over and over again).
Elon Musk didn’t say that, either. The press is lying again.

Here is Musk’s direct quote: “The waste and fraud in entitlement spending — which is most of the federal spending is entitlements — so, that’s, like, the big one to eliminate. That’s the, sort of half-trillion, maybe $6-700 billion a year.”

And he’s exactly right.

FACT: The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates taxpayers lose as much as $521 billion annually to fraud — and most of that is within entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.

FACT: Over the past two decades, the federal government has made an estimated $2.7 trillion in “improper payments” — the majority of which come in the form of “payments to deceased individuals or those who no longer [are] eligible for government programs.”

FACT: The Social Security Administration made an estimated $72 billion in improper payments between 2015 and 2022.

FACT: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimated it made $140+ billion in improper payments in 2024 alone.”

mm47xi2,ItsAllSoClear,"**Illegal aliens?** A symptom of the larger problem with our immigration policy. If folks need to resort to illegally entering our country for a better life we should probably have a system that works with them rather than against them. The argument is for immigration reform; we're just able to look past the issue of illegal immigration to see what the actual issue is unlike others that stop short of exploring cause and effect.

**Support fraud and waste in government?** Liberals are interested in rooting out corruption, fraud, and waste, but chainsaw surgery isn't the answer, as demonstrated by the mass firing and pleas for rehiring. Younger generations are painfully aware how difficult it is to get these old hats to retire and relinquish their power which is why we're rallying around the likes of AOC. The people in charge are too disconnected from the plight of the every person.

**Support terrorism?** Hamas are terrorists. The IDF are terrorists. Palestinians are not terrorists. The world does not adhere to a classic criminology philosophy: Black and white, good vs. evil morality is archaic. If this is regards to Tesla dealership vandalism I'm personally all for rejecting Nazis and their means of economic growth. Property damage is not human damage. To compare: During WW2, Nazis were (originally) German, but not every German was a Nazi. Same with Palestinians.

**Support shoving woke agenda down every American?** Are you upset at the prevalence of the message or the idea behind it? First, we could say the same about religious groups and oligarchs trying to recruit us to their causes or to behave a certain way through their platform. Annoying as it is, that's freedom of speech, and folks have a right to it as well as the consequences. The ""woke agenda"" has never negatively affected you or anyone you know. It may have benefited someone you know. The essence of ""woke"" is equity: Making sure everyone has the potential to achieve their goals without sacrificing the wants, needs, or ambitions of others. I'm not a POC, but I also know my history, and historically, white people have enslaved, red lined, harassed, murdered, you name it, all different POC. Acknowledging that and trying to lift affected communities up so that, long term, it doesn't happen again, is a perfectly fine agenda, imo. How would you define 'woke' and how has it negatively impacted you?

**Support lawlessness?** I think this is supposed to be a vague catch all for all of the above but even our own founding fathers said that it is our duty to disobey and fight back against unjust laws or actions by the government. Disappearing people is the most un-American, lawless behavior I can think of, so yeah, we should be fighting back against it, because if it can happen to someone else it can happen to you. Also, I'm not an indigenous person, and if my ancestors were turned away, I would have a very different (re: worse) life. They were able to immigrate to the USA and I, in turn, want to make sure that opportunity is available to others and future generations.

For context, I'm a huge fan of personal liberty: Shoot your guns, do your drugs, do what you want with your bodies and with other consenting adults. I have no interest in telling others what they can and can't do so long as it doesn't affect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The more the current administration tries to control our lives the more likely people are to resist. Americans do not like being controlled. We value independence.

I would implore you to spend time volunteering with marginalized communities to learn more about their struggles and what they're up against. Maybe get to know some of these people before you decide to tread on them, is all.",9,26226.0,1744152295.0,t1_mm41644,t3_1jugfrt,/r/UCDavis/comments/1jugfrt/my_prof_got_his_visa_revoked_over_the_weekend/mm47xi2/,False,,False

That being said, both of our beliefs probably have more to do with whether we trust the current administration. If you believe your government is looking out for the country as a whole it's much easier to assume that people getting their visas revoked must have done something wrong. Personally I don't, because even in the previous terms Trump made decisions that were in the interest of large corporations for short term gain, not the long term interests of the American people as a whole.

Even more so though, we see news of people who were given asylum being told they need to leave, people who participated in protests using their right to free speech having their visas revoked, travelers who entered the country before the Trump administration being detained when they wish to leave because the rules of travel changed while they were here, and it's only been a few months.

ICE is grabbing people left and right and some of them are being detained and held from their trials and deported before it occurs which is illegal. It's a disorganized clusterfuck meant to build numbers and look good meanwhile people are being detained and some of them have no idea why other than suddenly having their visa revoked.

Yeah, Hamas is a terrorist group that killed civilians and that’s obviouslty fucked up. But, Israel is a democracy with a professional military, supposed to follow international law. If we’re holding Hamas accountable for war crimes (as we should), then we’ve gotta hold Israel to the same standard when its soldiers block food, bomb refugee camps, or detain people without trial.

And let’s be real, where’s the accountability for soldiers who’ve shot civilians waving white flags or beaten detainees?

mmgmksd,keelhaulrose,">but they are not hiring  foreigners over americans.

What do you think is going on at Mar-a-Lago that American workers can't do? Trump has hired over 500 immigrants there. 

I don't have hate or animosity towards America, just the hypocrites running it at the moment.  I work in a school. Over 70% of the students in my school are children of HB1 visa holders.  Some are American born, some are immigrants themselves. I see how well these students are doing, how hard they work, and how bright they are, and I'm upset that so many people seem to think they and their families are somehow damaging this country.  Growing up,  I was always told America is a melting pot, and that was largely my experience.  I live near Chicago, I can go into town and immerse myself in a new culture every week if I want to and it would be well over a year before I'd repeat any. It wasn't until recently that a very vocal group decided that foreigners needed to assimilate our gtfo, and that's upsetting,  especially growing up Christian and being taught Jesus' words about accepting the foreigner in my land. 

But to hear Trump talk, you'd think that foreigners were absolutely destroying this country. Americans are the best and brightest... which is why he hired 500 people from other countries to do maintenence and service jobs at his private club. 

You think Americans are the greatest, and yet you support someone who hired foreigners to cut the grass.
