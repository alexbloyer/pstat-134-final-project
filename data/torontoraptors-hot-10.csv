mqrc582,Zozze1,"He played <20 minutes per game and came off the bench for 32 games.

So besides the 3&D, why would the Raptors pick him if they land at 7? They're not in the Spurs' situation where they have the luxury of having multiple first rounders and a generational talent in Wemby + Fox/Castle sitting around where Carter seamlessly fits into the lineup and can start eating up minutes. The Raptors have a dire need of on-ball creation. They're either dead last or at the very least near the bottom in isolation, PnR, and off the dribble shooting metrics. Poeltl had the best on/off metrics on the team because any option at the 5 beside him is costing the team points every time they're on the court. 

Needs aside, the Raptors may not even be in a position to be looking at needs. With a lack of star potential on the team, BPA probably is the way to go. I don't see Bryant being BPA over other players who would likely still be on the board by then.",4,10947,1746473068.0,torontoraptors

The on-ball creation will be happening way more with Ingram, a healthy Quickley and the development from Walter and Shead. And I get that we need a real 5 off the bench which is why I suggest we trade for one. I would rather give up Ochai and 2nds for a competent bench big than use a high draft pick on Maluach or Queen. This team has multiple holes to fill and I would rather go for the upside swing on a wing that theoretically has a higher ceiling and has more trade value than use such a valuable pick on an iffy bench big.

mrg4hul,MInkton,"Totally agree. 

People saying the Ingram trade was a bad one done understand talent acquisition, and the rare opportunity where we get a borderline allstar without giving up our picks(gave a shitty first)/starters/young talent. Also, they knew he wouldnt play so we could still tank (fuck you Philly, Utah, Nets, shamelessly sitting EVERYONE). 

Could he get injured and it not work out? Yes. Is it still worth a shot. Yes. Definitely yes at that cost.  Ingram could turn into our primary scorer, and closing scorer, which this team desperately needs. Not to mention I think his 3% will rise, as he will be getting fed more and have to rely less on pull-up 3's.

If we have IQ shooting and passing, RJ going downhill/rim pressure/corner 3, BI shooting 3's and creating his own shot from the midrange, Scottie being able to facilitate, get midrange shots up, and crash the boards for putbacks, and Yak facilitating, push shots, and rebounding. I feel like that is a real possibility and would be amazing.

  
Quickley - fucking idiotic how people were throwing him under the bus and saying he was a bust or overpay. HE WAS INJURED or returning from injury, and wasnt able to get into a flow. He deserves to get a stretch of uninjured play to be assessed. Definitely had some games and stretches where you see him looking like an all-star. I can also see him playing more off ball and Scottie running a bit more point forward, and letting IQ shoot more. 

SG logjam. Would love to see RJ work with this team, but can also see where it doesnt gel and we are able to package him up with some filler or picks (maybe with Jak?) for a better positional fit (perfect world stretch 5) or young talent/picks. He still has 2 years left on a relatively cheap contract. Could also see us trading RJ, for a negative contract for a year or two for draft picks or young player. RJ could be a great upgrade for a contender who has an underperforming player at around 25 million dollar mark

Taking time to develop Gradey and Ja'Kobe will be very important and if Ochai can keep his 3% up he is a great 8th guy off the bench, occasional starter. 

We could even package up RJ, either Gradey or Ja'Kobe and Yak (and picks?) for something special. That still leaves us good enough depth to be successful.",1,15572,1746809911.0,torontoraptors

I think this summer will be a big one fr player movement especially if teams like the Celtics, Cavs, Nuggets bow out in round 2. Those teams are expensive and will need to make moves.

So the issues goes beyond his pull-up shots. If there isn't a clear uptick next season, it'll indeed be a long-term project like Sabonis' and Siakam's outside shots. 

Regardless of any evolution, I think they need to adapt his gameplan more to his skillset anyway. Have him act more as a passing hub on the perimeter.

It was a small price to pay to obtain an All-Star level talent in his prime. The Pels can act like they fleeced us but we got a massive upgrade at a position of need for very cheap...Ingram is a 45+ million dollar player who we signed for substantially less because of his injury history and the fact that we were able to work out a deal before free agency. The alternative would have been to wait until free agency and then risk losing him to other teams who were willing to pay 40 plus million to him...they did that with FVV who's a tier below Ingram and look what happened...the Rockets threw 40 million at him and he signed with them.

mrcpehh,roostor222,"you can certainly do it by position if you want, but I don't think it's very meaningful when you can only pay two players that kind of money. There are 30 teams. 28 players played 30 minutes per game and had 28% usage or higher. Brandon Ingram ranked 23rd out of those 28 in true shooting this year. If your goal is to compete for a championship then that's never going to be good enough because almost every single night you're facing a better scorer.

He will have the #39 salary in the league next year and you're already paying Scottie Barnes more. You can't pay anyone else, so unless you get major scoring efficiency out of nowhere from a vet or a rookie, the offense has no shot be top 10, which is what you'll need to contend.

I understand your point about not wanting to take a step back and lose the salary while you're an over the cap team, but taking on a bad contract when you have no hope of real contention isn't good. Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley aren't good enough. RJ Barrett stinks. Adding Brandon Ingram to that mix isn't going to put you over the top and you'd have been better off bottoming out than taking on Ingram.",0,438,1746756391.0,torontoraptors
mrgdfo1,FallenLemur,"I think thats a valid criticism, but I also think the last time you guys had a real actual pg who can help facilitate the offense was when you guys had CP3.

We have Shead/IQ who are goof facilitating pgs, which the former showing sparks of being great at it.

RJ who is a good facilitator

Scottie who is great at it

Jakob who is for his position amazing at it. 

We also have a coach who preaches ball movement and doesnt like sticky hands.",1,373957,1746812602.0,torontoraptors
mrcqvgv,pakattack91,"You're pretty clearly shifting this efficiency thing to make BI seem like an inefficient chucker lol. Let's see how he does here, Darkos offence is very anti iso for the most part.

You're also, again, missing the key part. The choice was not ""pay BI or pay another FA"". It was ""pay BI or keep the picks"". Its not cpming out of my pocket lol. Try to address that if you respond to me again.

If you want to build a title team, you acquire assets and consolidate at the right time (ask me how I know).

Acquiring BI for 1 guy who was 100% gone and Kelly O + less than mid picks is an easy choice. Like so easy.",2,271200,1746756941.0,torontoraptors
mrcsc6h,roostor222,"I watched every minute of basketball that he played for six seasons. I'm not making it seem like he's an inefficient chucker. He is an inefficient chucker. He holds onto the ball forever, takes a long time to get to his spot dribbling the air out of the ball, takes a bad shot, and then does it all again the next time down the court. 

>You're also, again, missing the key part. The choice was not ""pay BI or pay another FA"". It was ""pay BI or keep the picks"". Try to address that if you respond to me again.

I don't see that as the fundamental decision, which is why I didn't address it as such. The pick is most likely going to be in the 20s, and will probably turn out to be of little consequence. The fundamental decision was whether to double down on mediocrity by adding Ingram to Quickley-Barrett-Barnes or to admit that core isn't winning anything and start moving pieces out the door. Absolutely no one else wanted to pay Ingram that money. No one wants any of the big contracts you have. You aren't acquiring assets and consolidating because there will be no consolidation trade if no one wants the players/contracts you have.",1,438,1746757497.0,torontoraptors
