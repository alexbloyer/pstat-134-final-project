mqgxn13,friendswithbillw,"Been a fan 30+ years and there always been two constants:

Bad luck and being mentally soft.

Bad luck: a perfect tip dunk game winner, the league scheduling an extra game in the regular season.. in Denver..  LA fires happen.. Kawhi misses the game.. lose our tiebreaker with them.. the injuries throughout the years. 

Lack of mental toughness: giving away games 1 and 4, not even showing up game 7, PG missing 2 FTs then the Valley Oop, choking in the bubble and against the Rockets.

Just a weird season because we weren‚Äôt supposed to be here, it was a fun season, but it‚Äôs still disappointing and sad as hell.

mqgyp8l,Niceguydan8,"-Harden's scoring was terrible.  His facilitating was great and the Nuggets were selling out on Harden early on. He was making the right decision a lot of the time despite his horrific scoring.

-That portion early in the 2nd when Dunn subbed in for Harden for ~2-3 mins was a fucking *disaster.*

-I think Kawhi as a first option guy is pretty much done.  Not assertive enough in most of these games, including this one. He's been good overall in the series, and definitely efficient.  But I think his volume is too low offensively for a non-facilitating offensive star.

-The bad shooting role players were generally awful in this game and this series.  Norm is a good shooter, but he falls in here too.  He was atrocious most of the series and I think probably the largest contributor to actually losing the series with how much he underperformed.

Overall though, really fun season! Definitely exceeded expectations.

I mean, he started holding the ball early on and just dribbling until the double team came.  He took 8 fucking shots.  8.  He didn't even turn it over much! Why Lue put Kawhi on Gordon when we have Batum.  

We got beat by a team that has no bench while we were fully healthy.  

Zu gotta go.  This is the perfect time to trade him.  His numbers are up.  But these last two games show that we are not going to win with him as the starting center.  Sure, he can matchup with Jokic, but he couldn't even dunk on him when he had the chance.  He's too nice.

So, who is gone?  We know Ben is gone, and maybe Coffey.  Batum might retire after this, he probably won't have a better season next year.  Mills is gone.  Eubanks has no guaranteed money for next year according to what I read, so he might be gone.  Harden will opt-in, most likely, not like we can get an upgrade for him.

mqiby1b,Niceguydan8,"I'm re-watching the game and have a couple of things I guess I didn't realize the extent of while watching real-time:

-The Nuggets were trapping Harden *hard* the whole game, [here's an example of what I'm talking about](https://imgur.com/a/0nbVsjV).  There are possessions where he's getting doubled shortly after crossing halfcourt. Usually (not always) he's making the right play, but there's some hesitancy after the pass out of the double from the other guys that let's Denver recover.

-Good god that 2nd quarter lineup with Kawhi, Batum, Norm, Dunn, Bogi was so god damn bad, lol. [This is the Kris Dunn effect and how he makes offense harder for every other player when he's on the court](https://imgur.com/a/rKStqc2)

-This one probably can't be understated: The lead absolutely ballooned when they started giving Norm these possessions in the 3rd and he was genuinely abysmal.  The game got out of hand when Norm was just throwing the ball away for no reason and the Nuggets got hot on the other end.  Prior to that stretch, the team was losing but it was like low-double digits at most.

I still think Harden overall could have/should have done better, but I think in a lot of these possessions that I'm looking at, he's making the correct decision and usually doing so in a timely manner. 

I think Denver just challenged the non-Harden players to beat them and they weren't able to do it.

mrfdkyj,GoblinTradingGuide,"I‚Äôm gonna be honest, probably not.  Not only has the guy endured crazy back injuries and his scoring has completely faded into non-existence, I think he really just doesn‚Äôt love basketball like someone like Kawhi or Harden does.  I think playing basketball is just like a job to Ben Simmons.  

That being said, if we can retain him for cheap and we use him as a bench player who can basically plug-in to the 1-4 and even the 5 in some instances then I think having him on the roster makes sense.

But astroturfing isn‚Äôt really possible unless you‚Äôre exploiting an existing belief system though. Getting positive value out of watching a team put out competitive 50+ win season even without a championship is a perfectly normal and regular way to engage as a fan. Probably more healthy too.
