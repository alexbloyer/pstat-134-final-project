Big - **Lauri Markkanen** \- 7'0"", average defender, 34.6% 3p shooter last season (a down year), career 37.1%

Big - **John Collins** \- 6'9"", average defender, 39.9% 3p shooter last season, career 36.3% (includes time playing through injured hand)

Big - **Taylor Hendricks** \- 6'9"", defensive monster, career 36.8% 3p shooter

Big - **Cooper Flagg** \- 6'9"", defensive monster, 38.5% 3p shooter last season (College)

and...

Small - whoever will get them the ball, either **Isaiah Collier** for the assist machine, or if we want a 5th shooter out there, **Collin Sexton** (last season 40.6% from 3, career 38.7%) or Keyonte George (last season 34.3% from 3, career 33.9%) ...

OR, if Cooper Flagg becomes comfortable enough to handle the ball and essentially run point, then another

Big - **Kyle Filipowsi** \- 6'11"", average defender (better perimeter defender than inside, which actually goes WELL with this combo), 35.0% 3p shooter last season.

The crazy thing? The best 3p shooter on the Jazz isn't even listed. We could also plug in **Brice Sensabaugh** \- 6'5"", poor defender, but 42.2% 3p shooter last season (career 39.2%).

The lineup, of ***Markkanen, Collins, Hendricks, Flagg, and Filipowski*** is almost legit, and it would be one of the tallest lineups ever, with a total height of 410 inches, WHILE ALSO having a lineup of 5 different good-to-great 3point shooters on the floor at the same time, with nobody under 6'9"". How do you even guard that?! (Sidebar, here's a fun article I found about tallest lineups ever - [https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/the-tallest-recorded-starting-lineups-in-nba-history](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/the-tallest-recorded-starting-lineups-in-nba-history) \- and this lineup would be just a couple inches short of an NBA record. Sub in **Walker Kessler** \- 7'0"", monster defender, for any of the 3 different 6'9"" guys, and you're at 413 total inches, second tallest NBA lineup ever)

In terms of ""on paper"" or ""if I were to play a season as the Jazz in 2k25"" or whatever, having a starting 5 of Markkanen, Collins, Hendricks, Flagg, and Filipowski, would be so much fun. It would be so, so awesome to see that random daydream come to life. Wow, that ended up being a long post.

The 92-93 Jazz were a disappointment going 47-35 and lost in the first round.    
  
The Jazz would replace every member of the 1992-93 roster except for Stockton and Malone over the next 3 seasons before making the NBA finals in 1997.   
  
I have always thought this would make a great documentary - how the franchise literally rebuilt its entire roster around the 2 superstars in just 3 years to get themselves into the NBA finals.

I think Utah Wasatch would have sounded weird for the first couple of years, but works really well in the long term. It is above all centric to the location of the team which I think is one of the best things a team name can do (I know funny coming from a die hard Utah Jazz fan) In a lot of ways it reminded me of the 76ers, the 49ers, The Pacers, The Phoenix Suns, or the Colorado Rockies.
