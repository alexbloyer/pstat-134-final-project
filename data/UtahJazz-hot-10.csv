Big - **Lauri Markkanen** \- 7'0"", average defender, 34.6% 3p shooter last season (a down year), career 37.1%

Big - **John Collins** \- 6'9"", average defender, 39.9% 3p shooter last season, career 36.3% (includes time playing through injured hand)

Big - **Taylor Hendricks** \- 6'9"", defensive monster, career 36.8% 3p shooter

Big - **Cooper Flagg** \- 6'9"", defensive monster, 38.5% 3p shooter last season (College)

and...

Small - whoever will get them the ball, either **Isaiah Collier** for the assist machine, or if we want a 5th shooter out there, **Collin Sexton** (last season 40.6% from 3, career 38.7%) or Keyonte George (last season 34.3% from 3, career 33.9%) ...

OR, if Cooper Flagg becomes comfortable enough to handle the ball and essentially run point, then another

Big - **Kyle Filipowsi** \- 6'11"", average defender (better perimeter defender than inside, which actually goes WELL with this combo), 35.0% 3p shooter last season.

The crazy thing? The best 3p shooter on the Jazz isn't even listed. We could also plug in **Brice Sensabaugh** \- 6'5"", poor defender, but 42.2% 3p shooter last season (career 39.2%).

The lineup, of ***Markkanen, Collins, Hendricks, Flagg, and Filipowski*** is almost legit, and it would be one of the tallest lineups ever, with a total height of 410 inches, WHILE ALSO having a lineup of 5 different good-to-great 3point shooters on the floor at the same time, with nobody under 6'9"". How do you even guard that?! (Sidebar, here's a fun article I found about tallest lineups ever - [https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/the-tallest-recorded-starting-lineups-in-nba-history](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/the-tallest-recorded-starting-lineups-in-nba-history) \- and this lineup would be just a couple inches short of an NBA record. Sub in **Walker Kessler** \- 7'0"", monster defender, for any of the 3 different 6'9"" guys, and you're at 413 total inches, second tallest NBA lineup ever)

In terms of ""on paper"" or ""if I were to play a season as the Jazz in 2k25"" or whatever, having a starting 5 of Markkanen, Collins, Hendricks, Flagg, and Filipowski, would be so much fun. It would be so, so awesome to see that random daydream come to life. Wow, that ended up being a long post.

The 92-93 Jazz were a disappointment going 47-35 and lost in the first round.    
  
The Jazz would replace every member of the 1992-93 roster except for Stockton and Malone over the next 3 seasons before making the NBA finals in 1997.   
  
I have always thought this would make a great documentary - how the franchise literally rebuilt its entire roster around the 2 superstars in just 3 years to get themselves into the NBA finals.

It is above all centric to the location of the team which I think is one of the best things a team name can do (I know funny coming from a die hard Utah Jazz fan) In a lot of ways it reminded me of the 76ers, the 49ers, The Pacers, The Phoenix Suns, or the Colorado Rockies.
