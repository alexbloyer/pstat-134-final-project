mq8549x,thegaykid7,"It sucks whenever one's fate is removed from their hands due to circumstances outside of their control, but it's an inevitability of life. The fact that Pop is remaining in his role as Team President is a good sign that his health is at a place where he feels comfortable continuing in an important function. Here's to hoping it stays that way for years to come.


Although I have to wonder if we would've ever been able to give Pop a proper sendoff even without the health issues. After all, he doesn't seem like the type of guy who would do the whole farewell tour nonsense (*cough LeBron cough*), so would we have even realized game x would be his last game? Maybe his contract would've been expiring or maybe fans would've sensed the possible moment and showered him with love one last time just in case. It's a moot point now, but it does ease the sting just a little bit. Either way, I doubt Pop cares about any of that.


As sad as it is for us to have to say goodbye to him, though, I'm sadder that Pop won't be able to get one last taste of and shot at playoffs success. I know that isn't the be-all, end-all of everything, especially for someone like him---he has said those awful rebuilding years were some of the most enjoyable he's coached and helped to reinvigorate him---but it's still a shame nonetheless. Wemby and Pop, in the playoffs for one last series of rodeos...well, such is life. Real tragedy is all around us, every day and in many forms, so I'm just glad he's still with us.


Thanks for the memories, Pop. A great, humble man who always made the game bigger than basketball, and a great example of leadership in a world where we seem to be prioritizing all of the wrong traits in our chosen leaders.

mqbo9tl,9thst_worker,"I have been a Spurs fan since I was 11 years old. I only know one coach for the San Antonio Spurs: that's Pop. No matter who steps in for Pop, whether it's Tim, Becky, Brett, or anyone else, Pop is always and will be the only Spurs coach in my heart. Pop demonstrated not only toughness in terms of coaching but also shared so much love and humanity with the players. I guess that's why so many people love him. Thank you, Pop. 

  
In term of the new coach, I really do not understand the decision. There are so many great coaches we can choose from. Taylor Jenkin, Miky Malone, Mike Brown, Mike Budenholzer... the list can keep going. Many of the coaches I mentioned earlier had relationship with the Spurs organization. Yes! Promoting Johnson is the easiest move, but is it the best move? In my opinion, Wendy, Fox, CP3, or even Castle is on a pretty tight timeline, in order for this group of great players to thrive, we need a better coach than Johnson.

Core Duties of an NBA Team President, as I understand it:

Sets the overall vision and direction of the team.

Works closely with ownership to align business and basketball goals.

May help develop long-term plans for winning championships, growing revenue, or expanding brand presence.

Supervises the general manager (GM) and supports major decisions like: Trades, free agency, and draft picks, Coaches, Player development

Not always involved in day-to-day player evaluations, but may weigh in on high-level roster construction.

Bridges ownership, basketball ops, and business ops (marketing, ticket sales, etc.).

Helps set and maintain the team’s culture and identity.

Involved in hiring senior staff and setting department goals.",1,362.0,1746201496.0,NBASpurs

mq9mw1r,xnoob69,"I get that Tim Duncan was the cornerstone of the Spurs dynasty, and there’s no denying his impact. But to say Pop couldn’t have won without him underestimates just how elite Popovich is as a coach.

Pop isn’t just a guy who lucked into a generational big man, he built a system that emphasized ball movement, defense, and team culture. That system made stars out of Parker, Ginóbili, and later Kawhi. Look at how he adapted over the years, from post-heavy sets around Duncan to positionless, three-heavy offenses in the 2010s. Few coaches evolve like that.

Also, Pop was instrumental in developing Duncan. Who’s to say he couldn’t have done the same with another high-level talent? You give Pop someone like Kevin Garnett or Dirk early on, and I’d bet he still ends up with rings. Maybe not five, maybe not as early, but championships? Absolutely still possible.

At the end of the day, great players and great coaches amplify each other. Pop without Duncan wouldn’t be the same, but to say he couldn’t have won at all? That’s selling him short.",2,3522.0,1746220551.0,NBASpurs

People hating because he didn't average 20 points a game or that he's in a weak rookie class are so dumb. His PPG was already improving a lot towards the end of the season that I think next season it should be closer to 20 points. That would be a great step for someone only in his 2nd year. 

He also plays like a vet. Maybe he won't have the best game some nights but he doesn't seem timid or afraid of big moments. And while he's confident, he's not overtly cocky or obnoxious about himself.

There's a lot to be excited about. The backcourt is set with him and Fox for a couple of years.",1,7734.0,1746022906.0,NBASpurs
