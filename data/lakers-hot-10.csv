2026 FRP is a swap

Lakers get 2 young good centers 

Another young defensive player who can play 2-3

An overpaid declining KCP as compensation, he is still good defensively and can find his shot back if Lakers playmakers create good looks for him, if not, he is expiring the year after and can be traded then (he will be more beneficial than Vando I think and shorter contract as well)

Use the TPMLE on a 3-4 or another guard like Exum, find 1-2 good vet mins (or buy a second round pick to try a young player), extend Hayes as 3rd center (or a get vet min Center). Doesn't matter if LeBron opts in or not.

You keep Reaves, in this scenario and you keep your 2031 pick as well, if necessary that can be spent though, try to get a few seconds back in that situation for a smaller trade at the deadline.

Why would Cavs do this: They are getting 5.6m salary relief next season and 11m for the season after. They are getting a very probable trade up in the next draft (their pick is heavily swapped though I don't know how it will work), they can cut Shake and stretch (for more savings next year) and keep Goodwin as the 15th player.

Why would Magic do this: Magic has 4 centers and 2 very big forwards. Banchero and M. Wagner's (their preferred center) extensions are coming next year, they have more extensions the year after. If they don't do anything they will be above the 2nd apron. They also have 4 picks in this draft where they can draft 1 or 2 centers. 

They get rid of KCP's big contract, WCJ's long one as well. 2.7m relief this season and a lot more in the upcoming seaons. They get Knecht and Gabe which can play in positions they desperately need (playmaking and shooting). They no longer need Harris and Joseph, they can reject their TOs (they have younger better alternatives now). Kleber can be a 3rd string stretch big for them (more Germans for them) for a season while they develop their new rookie center. Only negative contract they take over is Vando here, so maybe it is more realistic for Lakers to send its 2031 protected pick and take those 2 seconds.",-6,17536.0,1746801621.0,lakers

\- Will slow the tempo down on all the other scenarios, complementing Luka's game. Luka want to kill you in every possession with cold reads, but adding to his arsenal (pick and roll drives end one, step back threes, slow down in the paint and 2s, and trickshots of any kind) the old time ""post-repost"" we saw couple times with LeBron this year (but imagine that with a strong athletic beast like giannis), it will be game over.

Reality is Luka needs to get in shape, he got food poisoning killing us in a Lebron carry game.

Luka showing up in the fourth like he needed to wins us games. Look at brundon these games are low scoring you need a guy to get reliable 2pt buckets late in games.

Luka 2pt % this year and ability to burst past bigs n get those shots is dead n killed us.

They had, what, 30 games together? Maybe less? In a very congested schedule, with very little practice time and Luka coming off the biggest injury of his career. Even less with LeBron on the court as well. 

The expectation of them fitting together perfectly with very little vertical spacing is simply insane. 

Let‚Äôs see how they fit with a balanced roster and a new offensive scheme that wasn‚Äôt built with AD on the mind. Let‚Äôs see how they fit after a training camp and preseason.
