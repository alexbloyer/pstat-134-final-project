Putting aside my own personal feelings, this kind of shit is exactly what the Adelsons and Nico want. They're desperate for the fans to smile and cheer, and they're thrilled to have people like OP and others who constantly show up in this sub to tell people to shut up to become louder and more prevalent, so that we turn against each other. They want people like OP to turn on their fellow fans because they're not behaving the way they want.

""Toxic"" means destructive from within. I'd argue the only toxic ones involved in the Dallas Mavericks are the people running the team. The fans are some of the best in the league and are doing the best with what we have, while we watch an exact copy of last year's playoffs save for one team: the Mavericks.

I bet you that you thought Nico was a pretty good gm on Jan 1!  I mean PJ, Gaff, lively, Naji, Ky… great pickups!

Yes it is. Luka's departure left a HUGE playmaking hole on this team. And Kyrie's isn't good enough to shoulder the entire playmaking burden on his own. Case in point, in the final game of the season, PJ and Lively, in a win-or-go-home situation, dropped 0 points. That would've NEVER happened under Luka's watch. Because not only is Luka a top-5 scorer in the league, he's also a top-3 playmaker. He not only elevates himself, he elevates the players around him. Something AD has never been capable of. And the ""defense wins championships"" narrative Nico kept going on and on about like a Pokemon is way overblown. Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. Like against Memphis, we gave up 120 points. More than ANY playoff game last season, even the juggernaut Celtics, who had the #1 overall offense at the time. We in fact held those guys to 13 less ppg than their average. Defense was NOT the problem in the finals, it was our lack of offense and shooting, and we FIXED those issues in the off-season. Only for Nico to blow everything up for literally no reason. But anyways, back to the ""Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense"" point, you saw it against Memphis. On every other play, AD would fall to the floor thus causing him to run back late on defense and not be nearly as effective as he should be.",12,386843.0,1746722321.0,Mavericks

Instead of playing off ball for more than 50% of the time because Luka was initiating it felt like Kyrie was playing 40 minutes a game and for ALL 40 minutes he had the ball in his hands and was doing everything he possibly could to get us going. Absolutely this contributed to him getting injured, maybe not a 1 to 1 direct reason but it absolutely increased the odds of it happening because he was simply involved in every play, every attack into the paint (which is how he got hurt)

mrbr7p6,ATroisi12,"👆exactly. I’ll never understand Nico’s thinking that even when healthy this lineup would work because Kyrie and Klay aren’t playmakers, they aren’t PGs at all. 
“Defence wins championships” is bs. At the end of the day you still need to actually put the ball in the hoop. 
“We needed a top tier two-way player so we went out and got AD” is bs.

Both of those trades would’ve been better than AD and Christie ffs. 
They wanted to sink the franchise, mission complete.

mrckoau,cleaninfresno,"Completely rewriting history here just to cope with the trade. Crazy. Luka was bad on defense but received absolutely zero help from his team in the finals. Sure him fouling out to go down 0-3 was really rough but maybe if the entire team didn’t shoot like single digit percentages from 3 the first two games they’re not even in a position to go down 3 in the first place. And you wanna bring up Kyrie? Seriously?

I love Kai. He’s legit one of my favorite players ever and I felt that way before he got to Dallas. But he completely shat all over himself in the Finals. He averaged 14 fucking PPG playing in the Garden in that series when it was supposed to be his revenge series and he was supposed to be the championship vet that doesn’t get rattled by salty fans from a chapter of his career that had closed 5 years beforehand. He arguably somehow had a more embarassing series than Luka. You literally have Celtics fans in r/nba saying this and that it’s hilarious to blame Luka for losing that series but there’s always the few weirdos who want to feel like they’re on the edge for being Nico fans in what is almost universally considered across the entire sports world as the worst trade in basketball history.

You don’t think the 2024 Mavs could have beaten a 2023 Heat or the Pacers or some shit this year? After the 2023 Finals the Nuggets were being talked about as a potential dynasty and immediately crumbled. Boston looked like the 96 Bulls a year ago and are now on the verge of getting knocked out in the second round and are gonna be forced to soft blow it up this year due to financial concerns. Juggernauts rise and fall in the blink of an eye and windows for opportunity open up, *especially* nowadays in this age of parity. that was kind of the entire point of having a 25 year old superstar who would give you bare minimum 5 more years of being in the position to take advantage of those opportunities vs a 33 year old made of glass who will give you at best like 3 more years. Just because they made the Finals once and couldn’t beat the historically dominant team that happened to come out the other side, how is the answer to blow it up? The team got better. You proved you had something there for the next few years with the core of Luka/Kyrie/Lively/PJ/Gafford. Every team that wins a championship has to go through their licks and keep weathering the storm. Boston was in and out of the ECF every year without hoisting jack shit until they hit their peak and things broke their way last year with some injury luck and momentum… imagine if the Celtics blew it up and traded Tatum for old man Kawhi after losing to Golden State in 2022, if Dirk got traded for Shaq in 2006 or 2007.

Call me a fake fan or Luka stan, fair, but it’s hilarious to act like the entire Mavs fanbase shouldn’t be pissed off about throwing away a solid 5 year contention window.

“Cry babies on here” brother the entire arena of 20,000 real life Mavs fans was chanting for him to lose his job and the entire sports world as whole almost unanimously thinks it’s one of the worst moves in basketball history.

Outside of a few people who want to go against the grain or make a big deal out of how they actually care so much less than everyone else so they can wear some badge of honor that they’re better fan.

The fanbase as a whole isn’t moving anytime soon that’s why I brought up the thing from like two weeks ago where 20,000 people in the Mavs home arena were cheering the star player of the Lakers while despising their own GM. Nico’s name will forever be tied to Luka’s name and Luka’s name will forever be tied to Dallas, you will never hear the end of it for the rest of Luka’s career unless he magically flames out and retires in a year or something. Mavs vs Lakers will be every opening night tipoff and/or Christmas game for the next 2-3 years at minimum and you will hear about it in this sub. Every time the Mavs do well and the Lakers do poorly everybody everywhere will say Nico was right. Every time Luka does something successful which he will continue to do a lot of people will post here how they miss him. I don’t know how you’re gonna survive being here on the off chance that, god forbid, there’s a Mavs Lakers series.
