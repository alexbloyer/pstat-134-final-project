Putting aside my own personal feelings, this kind of shit is exactly what the Adelsons and Nico want.

Yes it is. Luka's departure left a HUGE playmaking hole on this team. And Kyrie's isn't good enough to shoulder the entire playmaking burden on his own. Case in point, in the final game of the season, PJ and Lively, in a win-or-go-home situation, dropped 0 points. That would've NEVER happened under Luka's watch. Because not only is Luka a top-5 scorer in the league, he's also a top-3 playmaker. He not only elevates himself, he elevates the players around him. Something AD has never been capable of. And the ""defense wins championships"" narrative Nico kept going on and on about like a Pokemon is way overblown. Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. Like against Memphis, we gave up 120 points. More than ANY playoff game last season, even the juggernaut Celtics, who had the #1 overall offense at the time. We in fact held those guys to 13 less ppg than their average. Defense was NOT the problem in the finals, it was our lack of offense and shooting, and we FIXED those issues in the off-season. Only for Nico to blow everything up for literally no reason. But anyways, back to the ""Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense"" point, you saw it against Memphis. On every other play, AD would fall to the floor thus causing him to run back late on defense and not be nearly as effective as he should be.",12,386843.0,1746722321.0,Mavericks

mrckoau,cleaninfresno,"Completely rewriting history here just to cope with the trade. Crazy. Luka was bad on defense but received absolutely zero help from his team in the finals. Sure him fouling out to go down 0-3 was really rough but maybe if the entire team didn‚Äôt shoot like single digit percentages from 3 the first two games they‚Äôre not even in a position to go down 3 in the first place. And you wanna bring up Kyrie? Seriously?

I love Kai. He‚Äôs legit one of my favorite players ever and I felt that way before he got to Dallas. But he completely shat all over himself in the Finals. He averaged 14 fucking PPG playing in the Garden in that series when it was supposed to be his revenge series and he was supposed to be the championship vet that doesn‚Äôt get rattled by salty fans from a chapter of his career that had closed 5 years beforehand. He arguably somehow had a more embarassing series than Luka. You literally have Celtics fans in r/nba saying this and that it‚Äôs hilarious to blame Luka for losing that series but there‚Äôs always the few weirdos who want to feel like they‚Äôre on the edge for being Nico fans in what is almost universally considered across the entire sports world as the worst trade in basketball history.

You don‚Äôt think the 2024 Mavs could have beaten a 2023 Heat or the Pacers or some shit this year? After the 2023 Finals the Nuggets were being talked about as a potential dynasty and immediately crumbled. Boston looked like the 96 Bulls a year ago and are now on the verge of getting knocked out in the second round and are gonna be forced to soft blow it up this year due to financial concerns. Juggernauts rise and fall in the blink of an eye and windows for opportunity open up, *especially* nowadays in this age of parity. that was kind of the entire point of having a 25 year old superstar who would give you bare minimum 5 more years of being in the position to take advantage of those opportunities vs a 33 year old made of glass who will give you at best like 3 more years. Just because they made the Finals once and couldn‚Äôt beat the historically dominant team that happened to come out the other side, how is the answer to blow it up? The team got better. You proved you had something there for the next few years with the core of Luka/Kyrie/Lively/PJ/Gafford. Every team that wins a championship has to go through their licks and keep weathering the storm. Boston was in and out of the ECF every year without hoisting jack shit until they hit their peak and things broke their way last year with some injury luck and momentum‚Ä¶ imagine if the Celtics blew it up and traded Tatum for old man Kawhi after losing to Golden State in 2022, if Dirk got traded for Shaq in 2006 or 2007.
