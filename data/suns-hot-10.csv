I‚Äôm not sure I can fully explain why I liked his presser more, but he came across as more personable and relatable. He did a great job of acknowledging his success with the Nuggets without relying too heavily on it to claim he knows how to win. Instead, he seemed to understand that this is a new opportunity to build something unique using his experience, rather than forcing the team to fit his own established vision.

That was something I felt was a problem with Bud and Ishbia. Both seemed more focused on implementing their own idea of what winning should look like, rather than evaluating the roster and figuring out how to maximize the talent already there.

mqy9lcw,MaxPrints,"That article, if it's all true, sounds damning. Basically, Ishbia is promoting his guy, and the narrative was there that he was a big part of Dunn and Oso being drafted may just be fluff to support the promotion. 

And the people who **were** instrumental in making the call? Gone:

>  
""Internally, sources suggest Gregory‚Äôs fingerprints were all over the draft process, a sentiment reinforced by public framing following his promotion.  
""Sources confirm that Madkins, Fliposki, and their personnel team ‚Äî including¬†David Sevush¬†(manager of player personnel evaluation), and scouts¬†Charles Payne¬†and¬†Darrel Johnson¬†‚Äî were central in pushing for the selections of Dunn and Ighodaro, valuing their defensive upside and cultural fit within a roster built around¬†Kevin Durant,¬†Devin Booker, and¬†Bradley Beal.

>""But that narrative, while convenient, may be oversimplified ‚Äî and misleading.

>""Multiple league sources and reports indicate that the final calls on Dunn and Ighodaro weren‚Äôt made by Gregory, but rather by assistant GM¬†Gerald Madkins¬†and front office executive¬†Kyle Fliposki. Madkins, who joined the Suns in 2023 after holding a similar assistant GM role with the New York Knicks from 2017‚Äì20, brought nearly two decades of personnel and scouting experience to the table. His resume includes stops in Houston, New Orleans, and the Clippers, where his ability to identify under-the-radar talent was widely respected.

>""However, despite their contributions, Madkins, Sevush, Payne, and Johnson are all reportedly out of the organization. While their departures haven‚Äôt been officially announced, sources familiar with the Suns‚Äô internal discussions confirm that the exits are not coincidental ‚Äî they reflect a broader organizational reshuffling that‚Äôs left many inside the franchise stunned.

>""There‚Äôs a belief that no one knows who‚Äôs in charge, one high-ranking league source said.¬†

>‚Äú'This is a horror movie,' they shared.""  


The last two bits are more opinion, but I'm leaving it because of the multiple open quotations across all paragraphs.

To be fair, we don't know what Gregory is capable of, and he could end up being a diamond in the rough. What bothers me is that it seems the hiring process is obviously skewed towards having a relationship with Ishbia and a history with MSU more than actual experience or credentials.

mqz40n9,shaad20,"It‚Äôs going to depend on your company and its culture, there are successful companies with all sorts of different approaches to this.

Where I‚Äôm at currently, directors and vps absolutely would be telling their managers ‚Äúwhat‚Äù to do. And they‚Äôre told what to do (at various levels of involvement) from the C level and above. 

They aren‚Äôt necessarily telling their direct reports how to do it, how long it should take. And obviously they‚Äôre involved in back and forth conversations where both sides are able to give input. But the person at the top of the org is always going to dictate the direction/vision, and the rung below needs to be capable of getting that done.

And ultimately it‚Äôs my beliefs that your best managers AND leaders need to be capable of executing the company‚Äôs vision. They‚Äôre not some rogue entity telling everyone that they know better.

Ryan Dunn finished his rookie season 31.1% from 3.

The fact that Beal and Bridges were comparable in your cherrypicked numbers on offense isn't an argument in Beal's favor. Beal is a much worse defender and misses a ton of time. It only gets worse for Beal if you factor in the context of how each team uses them. Beal had the easiest job in the world: Be the third option with Booker and Durant. There were zero teams who were scheming against Beal, and he still was nowhere near an elite scorer. Even when he was playing against the opposing benches for over a month. Meanwhile, Bridges was in a Marion-type role with an offense that was not at all interested in prioritizing opportunities for him. He's comparably efficient to Beal while playing far, far more minutes and having actual defensive responsibilities. Look up some impact metrics. Beal's bad.
