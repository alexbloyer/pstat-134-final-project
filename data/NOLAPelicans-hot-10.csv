Gayle Benson doesn't care about winning. She has no passion for sports. The Saints consistently receive failing grades from players...based on facilities and perks. It comes out every year on the NFL report card.

This management wants to constantly tweak things, but gets rid of any cohesiveness the team has to offer, and they‚Äôve been doing it since letting go Monty Williams. It‚Äôs always a move to get rid of one young player to nab a ‚Äúmore established‚Äù older player, leading to a heavy top end without a supporting cast, a la Phoenix this year.

I think the biggest thing we need to figure out is when we draft a high end player or trade for a young high end player is keeping them healthy and helping them mature and become a true professional on and off the court.  A lot of this is also on the player to take their careers seriously from day one.

mqq4c8a,the_cream_dreamer,Nice write up. I'm so skeptical with this team right now. Willie Green is a lame duck head coach. Dumars hasn't built a roster in over a decade.

Honestly, and this is obviously the conspiracy theorist side of me speaking, what are the chances that Adam Silver wants to push a Zion trade to a large market and in return we get Flagg? Almost a replica of AD and Zion in 2019. Kidding, of course, but imagine.

Teams like the Pels don't get saved by outside superstars, the only way we can really compete is by being smarter than other teams, drafting and developing talent, and using our assets to get the final piece of the puzzle. OKC is doing this right now (last night's game notwithstanding). Milwaukee developed Giannis and Khris and then traded for Jrue to put them over the top. Denver developed Jokic and Murray and traded for Gordon as the perfect complement. Sometimes the order can change a bit, like Cleveland trading for Donovan Mitchell, but that was a huge risk and it's only working out because they drafted and developed Garland and Mobley and managed to get Jarrett Allen on the cheap from Brooklyn. These are all smart moves that leverage the opportunities they had and striking at the right time. Trading for a bunch of superstars is what teams like Boston, Brooklyn, LA, Miami, and Phoenix do, places that the players already want to go.

The most frustrating thing is that the Pels have had more opportunities to do this than basically any other team. We won the lotto for two generational prospects in the last 15 years, and with Zion we had tons of assets to build it the right way, and hit other draft picks. And now we're here.

And believe me, I know this is far fetched, but very doable. I guess I should've asked if our offers were enough.
