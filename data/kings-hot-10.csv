Gotta say, this Demar/Lavine/Sabonis/monk experiment might have been the ugliest basketball I‚Äôve ever seen, and that‚Äôs including the 20 years of losing basketball.

They simply cannot take care of the ball. There‚Äôs zero chemistry between these 4 when the monk/sabonis pnr gets taken away. Endless DHOs that lead to nothing, demar or Zach have to launch a wild shot at the end of the shot clock, and that‚Äôs only when they manage to hold onto the ball.

Those 4 are probably among the worst defenders in the league too. Not just physically deficient at their positions, but bottom-tier IQs from all of them defensively.

This big 4 has gotta be the worst +/- starting lineup in the league. Like worse than most of New Orleans lineups.

Blow this shit UP.

Start with sabonis and Demar. Monk will ask out. Can‚Äôt move Lavine because he‚Äôs THAT bad, but it‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôs an excellent tank commander. Keegan, Keon and Carter you should try to keep, but give them away if you have to.",17,14837.0,1744867019.0,kings
mnj7nyj,SuckThisRedditAdmins,"Always remember that 12 minutes of basketball was all this sorry squad could cobble together for the most loyal fans in the NBA.  12 mins of basketball to cheer for.  That was it.

Remember that Vivek thinks it is ok to gouge those same fans with exorbitant ticket and concession prices despite them supporting a shit product year after year after year.

He employs shitty GM after shitty GM who mortgage the franchise's future for ""win now"" moves that make us worse than the year before.  Or don't draft the OBVIOUS generational talent because of stupidity, hubris, or both.

We looked at the Chicago Bulls, a team that could not win in the East, and not just emulated them but fucking RECREATED them right down to the same losing players.  Vivek is a clown, Monte is a clown, everyone on this squad is a clown.

Don't give Vivek and the Sacramento Kings another dime of your money until either he is gone or he proves he can properly own an NBA franchise.  No gear, no tickets, nothing.  As far as I am concerned, the playoff drought never ended because we lucked into that playoff seeding with a destroyed Western Conference... and even then we couldn't win a series.

mnjeqno,BuzzerBeater27,"Its not good when our 45 m per year all star C keeps getting outplayed by Gafford/Lively/Looney type role player centers (esp in important games), which arent even hard to find nowadays. Also much easier on the books, leaves you more cap room to spend at other positions. 

Domas shortcomings makes it harder for everyone else on defense, while his offense just isnt good enough to make up for it. At this point its fair to say he cant create his own shot against good defenses, floor stretching isnt there either he still gets sagged off all the time. Most of the competitive teams have the personnel to nullify his rebounding impact as well. Just being a screener & dho hub aint worth anything close to 40m lets keep it real.

He had plenty of time to improve on his shortcomings to become a more complete offensive player here but its yet to happen, atp I wouldnt be opposed to trading him at all.

Also no idea how some people seriously believe Keegan has potential to be a franchise player, he consistently has trouble handling the ball, even against weak defenders on single coverage. His potential is an elite 3&D (which is still nice to have but def not a top 3 player in a contending team) given what we seen in his first 3 seasons, and its been a while since his 3 ball was reliable as well.

Basically what Minnesota was running the last 2 seasons with Gobert and KAT. 

But that‚Äôs easier said than done and idk who you find‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre much more likely to find a larger/better defensive 4 to put along side Sabonis at the 5. So when Naz Reid opts out of his contract, you throw all the money in the world at him to be your new 4 or you trade away Lavine or Demar to the Pelicans to make Zion your new 4 and then slide Keegan to the 3, have Lavine at the 2‚Ä¶ unless he‚Äôs gone, then Keon at the 2 and a real true pass first high IQ PG at the 1.

mrbroc3,INeedAVape,"Because too many of the fans in this sub talk 'floor spacing' and think that every team is trotting out four proficient three point shooters in their starting lineup.  

But there are only 5 teams that had four starters shooting over .350 from 3pt range and taking 4 or more three pointers a game.  Between the Knicks, Bulls, Raptors, Pistons, and Spurs.  Of those five teams, only two of them made the playoffs. 

Among the top 4 seeds in both conference, Cleveland, Boston, OKC, and Houston; all four of them had three starters shooting over .350 from 3pt range and taking 4 or more a game.

16 teams had 3 starters that took more than 4 three pointers a game while shooting over .350.  Three teams had two.  Five teams had one.  The Magic didn't have one starter that shot over .350 from three while taking over 4 per game.

The entire argument that you need to have a 4 or a 5 that shoots three pointers proficiently to compete in today's 'floor spacing game' just doesn't hold up when you take a closer look at the stats.

For Sabonis to take 2 three pointers a game and shoot over .400 is good for his size.  It's his defense at either the 4 or the 5 that makes it tough to build a starting lineup with him in it.",2,8002.0,1746744047.0,kings

Also if you can swap Lavine for Zion, you do that. This team can play without Lavine, they‚Äôve showed it many times last season. So even if you only get Zion for 30-45 games, you take that. His ceiling is bananas higher. We aren‚Äôt gonna get any other ‚Äúpotential superstars‚Äù to come here/we can‚Äôt make a trade to bring them here and we aren‚Äôt gonna rebuild. 

So you gamble on Zion having a healthier lifestyle here and play enough games here to drastically change your teams performance.

Putting him at the 4 would be an absolute disaster. He'd be eaten alive, and that doesn't even address the fact that his 3PT shooting comes only when he's uncontested. It would be a monumental task (I'd argue impossible) to not only get him shooting 3s with a close-out or hand in his face, but shooting them at a good percentage.

Ideally I could see DeRozan going somewhere like Lakers for Rui Hachimura & Dalton Knecht and maybe we get a second back, I know the salary on this works and seems like a pretty fair trade for both sides so not really pushing picks for either side.

mrc1svo,vNocturnus,"You really think that if this team replaced DeRozan with an all-around elite 2-way point forward they couldn't make the playoffs?

Keon/LaVine/Murray/Flagg/Sabonis is a good lineup. Carter, Monk, JV, and maybe LaRavia if they can keep him is a solid bench. + whatever trading DeRozan gets you.

They wouldn't be a top 4 seed but that starting lineup has very few holes - basically just missing an elite iso scorer (though LaVine sometimes is, when he feels like it) and a ""rim protector."" But I think the latter is overrated; the defense would still be really good between Ellis/Murray/Flagg and the rebounding would still be elite.

The only thing that's crazy about this scenario is winning the lottery and getting Flagg - which, yeah, that's obviously not going to happen lol. But this was a hypothetical that was already assuming getting him",9,53827.0,1746747648.0,kings

mrcju98,vNocturnus,"Flagg is a primary ball handler, Domas is also a high level offensive hub. In this theoretical scenario Keon is at most the tertiary ball handler, possibly even less than that with LaVine also being able to create offense a bit.

Plus, he just started running point with any kind of frequency more than halfway into last season. He looked better as he got more comfortable in the role and I think he has tons of potential to continue improving in that aspect of his game. He shouldn't be the plan A at the PG position unless they bring in a legitimate point forward like Flagg (and there's probably none on the trade market, so that's a really unlikely scenario), but if they do pull that off I think he's a *fantastic* option at the ""PG"" position given his shooting and defense.",1,53827.0,1746754317.0,kings

mrcl9l7,vNocturnus,"well the Kings probably can't get rid of LaVine in this or any situation lol. And from the sounds of it Perry doesn't plan to, in his opening statements he talked about putting pieces around LaVine to win.

Maybe getting Flagg would change his mind, imo in that scenario it would make it a lot more palatable to do a proper blow up which would likely cost assets to pull off (to move off of LaVine, certainly, and possibly also DeRozan).

But again, in this magical christmas land, Flagg is a primary ball handler. I don't think it makes sense to get rid of the best scorer on the team for another ball handler when you just got a ball handler (Flagg) and presumably lost a scorer (DeRozan).

While Beal has taken a lot of heat for his drop off since coming over from the Wizards, the Suns should really have made the playoffs if Durant was still a true star player.

So I'd be a bit more hesitant in how much I gave up for him, how much I relied on him, and I'd be curious if KD is willing to play the role necessary to win at this stage of his career or if he's locked into a need to be superstar.

A terrible roster that is overseen by a guy with next to no coaching experience is not a recipe for the playoffs. It would be one thing if they were looking to lose as many games as possible. However, we know that's not the case. Which means we're most likely look at a 7-12 lottery seed for the foreseeable future.
