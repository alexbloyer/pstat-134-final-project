Caitlin is a good player but she lacks the charisma to make the WNBA into what Jordan did in the 90s.  Women's sports are unfortunately still going to be so far behind their male counterparts because of sponsorship and television rights. Tennis is the only sport I can remember having more viewership for the women's games than the men, and that was at the height of the William sisters dominance.  The WNBA needs more than Caitlin to get it to even close to what Jordan did for the NBA in the 90s.
