mrfdhg3,foye2smith,"Love that the offense clicked. If Minnesota scores 110+ then Golden State is going to struggle to keep pace. They don't have the horses without Steph. Hell, 100+ may be a struggle. 

Also really appreciated the defense last night. The multiple shotclock violations. Jaden not biting on any of Jimmy's pumps. They stayed glued to Buddy Hield for the most part and he still went 4-9 from deep, ya just tip your cap to that.  Kuminga made three jumpers which is found money for them; he shot 33% from 10-14ft, 21% from 15-19ft, 28% from 20-24ft, and 33% from 25-29ft. He may not make three jumpers the rest of the series. 

Probably my favorite adjustment was Rudy playing up on Draymond. Game 1 they gave him ""dare"" shots and he took and made them. Rudy was still playing more for the drive, but he was out there just enough that Draymond wasn't going to take a semi-contested three. Also just that little bit of ball pressure made it that much more difficult for Draymond to act as the hub of their offense.",3,54013.0,1746801684.0,timberwolves

mrf8cei,JaderMcDanersStan,"Genuine question - why does the sub feel the Wolves were ""out hustled last night by a large margin""? 

It's possible I'm remembering the hustle plays more than other moments because I was there in person - since the crowd got really into it whenever there was a hustle play, those plays might have stuck with me more. I thought the Wolves hustled a lot...

Donte and Naz were diving for balls (Naz even hurt himself by throwing his body on the floor at one point), Wolves players sprinted to save the ball when it was going out of bounds several times, forced turnovers, shotclock violations etc. Whenever Warriors went on a run, Wolves consistently responded with their own run usually due to defense. Before garbage time, Wolves had more rebounds as well. Mike Conley was chasing Hield all over. All these things are the definition of hustle.

 I'm curious why other people interpreted their play as a bad game and being out-hustled. They were missing layups and it wasn't their best offense sure, but how are people accusing their hustle, defense and effort? I thought effort and defense was one of the best parts of that game 😂 But I naturally tend to focus on defense more and was there live, so maybe I missed stuff or am selectively remembering plays.

mrgu1ml,HoopsJ,"A few random thoughts:

Felt like a B game from the Wolves and they still won big, which is nice. Would really like to see Ant and Rudy get going more on offense though

Shoutout to the bench, especially NAW. This team is going to be very hard to beat if they can hit those shots. I was a little worried about NAW since he’s had a poor start to the playoffs; hopefully now he has the monkey off his back.

The Warriors sub seems surprisingly optimistic. It seems like most think Kerr conceded the game and just wanted to see who’s playable and who’s not. I think there’s some truth to that, but if Curry remains out, I don’t know if there’s a combination of players that can get them to win games here. I truly believe the Wolves will have to beat themselves to lose.

mrfk8a4,DeanEvasonPunch,">Genuine question - why does the sub feel the Wolves were ""out hustled last night by a large margin""?

The simplest answer is because SVG said it on the broadcast a few times. So that sticks in people's minds.

More specifically though, they are still giving up some uncontested wide open backdoor cuts on defense due to lack of communication or rotation. And they've given up a few one pass transition baskets after scores because they didn't get back and get set on defense.",2,34307.0,1746803740.0,timberwolves

It has always been nuts to me that these fanbases act like huge rivals. Fights at games between 9ers and Rams/Giants and Dodgers/Lakers and Warriors. And yet, pretty much every one of these fanbases has that huge contingent that fulfills the stereotype of people who will just gravitate to the other CA team when it's doing well. When I was a kid in the gateway cities (East LA county), a bunch of people abandoned the Dodgers for the Giants. A decade later, they all adopted the 9ers because they were good. The last time I visited home a year ago, I saw A LOT of 49er stuff and Warriors stuff in SoCal. Until Lebron got traded to LA, pretty sure the Warriors were the NBA team for all of CA.

The people who even consider trading those two didn’t watch the Wolves prior to 2020, Jaden may be the best defender in Wolves history when all is said and done. I know there is no stat for time spent chasing around the other teams best player and ensuring they don’t get a high percentage shot, but he does it every game along with so many other small things that are hard to notice if you’re not looking for them.

Jaden and Ant have been lights out on defense almost every minute of the playoffs so far!",10,1101.0,1746812749.0,timberwolves
