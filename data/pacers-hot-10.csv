I was there last year for the Nembhard shot.

Brunson had just gotten a steal and couldn‚Äôt dunk it so he switched it to a lay in. Knicks fans had taken over the arena chanting ‚ÄúMVP.‚Äù I‚Äôm dying laughing, a few drinks in, because he couldn‚Äôt dunk it and the Knicks fans next to us were legit getting mad because I said **‚ÄùI** can jump higher than that.‚Äù We won that game and to this day that shot was the most insane I‚Äôve ever seen one place go. The NY fans weren‚Äôt very talkative after.

The next day I‚Äôm at sweetgreen eating a salad outside in Indy (I‚Äôm a resident) with my fianc√© and dog- with my Haliburton jersey on. Some more NY fans drive by screeching ‚ÄúKnicks in 6,‚Äù at me. I rolled my eyes and waved them on.

The only thing I remember about the game itself was that we had a huge lead in the 4th, and Pacers legend Primoz Brezec had a sick and-1 lay-in that I was super hyped for.

Skip ahead to May 25 of that year, when the Pacers hosted the Bulls for ECF Game 4.

Little did we know we were going to witness the biggest shot in franchise history.

I was 10 years old, had just moved to Indy and didn‚Äôt know anybody. I started talking to some kid on my dad‚Äôs club football team because he was also new to the area and neither of us had any friends. He mentioned how his dad had an extra ticket to the Pacers game and asked me if I wanted to go. I was just excited to go and possibly make my first friend, that I didn‚Äôt even ask who they were playing.

Turns out it was against the Bulls coming off their 2nd championship in a row, led by the most famous person on the planet at the time. This was the infamous game where Reggie and MJ got into a fight and were both disqualified. 

It was like the coolest thing in the world to a 10 year old who had never been to a pro sports game. I became a lifelong Pacers fan after that, and 32 years later, that kid is still my best friend.

mrgjuqg,Newfie-Decker,"My favorite pacers moment was when Reggie nailed that 3 over MJ. I'm from small town east coast Canada, and basketball was never really that big there, hockey rules supreme, even I ""hated"" basketball. Couldn't tell you why, just did because that's what most of the people did. A few kids from school spoke about basketball and it was fun playing it, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I started watching a bit, and this Jordan guy was the one to watch. For lack of better words, I've always been a fan of the different. I liked different music than everyone, I liked different cartoons and shows than all my friends. Hell, I even liked a hockey team that no one cheered for (geographically the team that was the furthest away from me). So when I was watching the game against the pacers, and I could feel it washing over me.... Small market team, not a lot of publicity, and they had this guy that people really didn't like.... This is probably gonna be my team.... I watched in pure excitement and agony all in one. The clock is ticking down, things can happen with so little time, I'm on the edge of the couch and don't even realize it, Reggie comes off the screen, catches the ball, elevates and shoots..... I don't even realize it, I'm standing, a foot away from the TV, hands on my head.... As the ball enters the hoop, BOOM BABY! I'm a full blown Pacer fan! I'm cheering super loud, my parents come running to see what the commotion is, and I'm jumping up and down yelling he made it he made it! He made what? they asked with huge eyes. That shot, he made it!  That Miller guy, he made that shot. My parents are baffled at me, they shake their heads and leave the room. But it was that moment, that one basket that made me a Pacer Fan. Years later in my adult life, I made a trip to Indianapolis so I could take in a Pacer game live. I loved it, and want to do it again. It's nice remembering that moment, thanks for asking that, and having this giveaway! Good luck to everyone!",1,2185,1746814523.0,pacers

mrfmd9f,reidhoch,"> Steve Prohm was the head coach at Iowa State and coached Tyrese Haliburton for two seasons from 2018-2020.

> The first thing that strikes people about Tyrese is his ability to interact with anyone. His charisma. I was no different.

> When I was the head coach at Iowa State, I went to Las Vegas in the summer to watch him play in a tournament. One of my assistant coaches had a relationship with Tyrese, but this was my first time watching him in person.

> I don‚Äôt think he ran up and down the floor more than three times before my assistant coach and I looked at each other like: We need this kid.

> He could shoot, he could pass, but it was so much more than his basketball ability. I watched his mannerisms. I watched his personality. I watched his communication. I even watched the way he interacted with the refs. He was talking with them, but he wasn‚Äôt pissing them off. He almost had a bond with them. Then he was off talking with teammates or his coaches. He just had such a presence.

> I believe the face of your team, your leader, has to connect with people and the community. I knew then he could do that.

> Another sign of a great leader is humility. Tyrese had that when he came in the door.

> Before his freshman season, we had a reunion with former players. The final night, we were out at a sports bar in town, talking. He looked at me across the table and said, ‚ÄúCoach, this thing was awesome. This is why I wanted to come to Iowa State. I wanted to be around all these former players. I wanted to be around greatness.‚Äù

> That showed humility.

> We had a good team his freshman year. I remember his dad, John, told him: ‚ÄúFind the best older player that has a routine and understands how to work and get with him and learn how to work every single day.‚Äù

> For us that season, that player was Marial Shayok, a fifth-year senior. Tyrese kept his eyes on everything Marial did that year, and because of that, I think he learned how to really work at the highest level. That, too, showed humility.

> Early on in Tyrese‚Äôs freshman season, an NBA scout came to one of our practices. We practiced for an hour or two, and when we were winding down, the scout called me over.

> ‚ÄúYou know who your highest draft pick is going to be?‚Äù he asked me.

> I didn‚Äôt know. We had Shayok and Talen Horton-Tucker, another freshman who was a big-time recruit. I thought the scout could have been talking about several guys.

> ‚ÄúTyrese Haliburton,‚Äù he said.

> ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTell me why.‚Äù

> Tyrese had maybe played a total of 10 or 11 games at that point. ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôve watched him all practice,‚Äù the scout said. ‚ÄúHe resonates with the older guys. He listens to everything they say. He fits into everything you‚Äôre doing. He takes coaching. His presence and demeanor are always positive, he always has energy. He‚Äôll be your highest draft pick.‚Äù

> It‚Äôs a good reminder: People are always watching.

> Tyrese‚Äôs personality, his smile, his demeanor allowed him to connect with anybody from any walk of life. Because of his presence, because of his personality, he empowered other guys to be better.

> After Tyrese‚Äôs freshman year, I met with him to talk about his future. He had some NBA interest, and I wanted to see what he wanted to do. It was the easiest talk. He already had a plan.

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming back to school,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to go through all these workouts. I need to get here and get bigger, stronger and better. Next year, if I‚Äôm a lottery pick, I‚Äôm going to leave.‚Äù

> That summer, he played for the United States at the FIBA Under-19 World Cup. He came back for his sophomore year with another level of confidence.

> He was one of the guys who came to the gym or office every day with a smile and personality. You always knew he was there. You could always hear him.

> He was just so positive, and his energy was contagious. That was one of his biggest traits as a leader. He kept everybody fresh and excited.

> During his sophomore season, however, he broke his wrist. He sat out for a little while and tried to come back and then hurt it again. It just wasn‚Äôt smart for him to keep playing. He needed surgery.

> We knew then he was going to be a lottery pick. A lot of guys would have left school and gone to get ready for the draft on their own, so he and I met again to talk it out. It was also an easy conversation: He was headed for the NBA Draft, but he wasn‚Äôt leaving the team.

> ‚ÄúCoach, I‚Äôm going to be at every practice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be at every game. I‚Äôm not going nowhere. We‚Äôre gonna finish this thing out together.‚Äù

> His mom, Brenda, still came to every game. Tyrese was as animated and into it, with a cast on his hand, as when he was playing. He understood that it was more than just about him. He knew it was important that he was still a connector.

> Two months ago, I got let go from Murray State. Right around that time, Tyrese hit a game-winner against the Milwaukee Bucks. The next day, I was in the school pickup line to get my 10-year-old. My phone rang. It was Tyrese.

> He told me: ‚ÄúHey, Coach, I just wanted to check in on you. I just wanted to make sure you know I‚Äôm thinking about it. If you need anything, let me know.‚Äù

> When you get fired, your whole family goes through it. For my kids to hear him on the phone and think, ‚ÄúYou know what? My dad‚Äôs done all right,‚Äù that helped in my recovery.

> That‚Äôs what the great ones do. When they know people are down, they lift them up. That‚Äôs leadership.
