mrg6w16,kidkuro,"Long one since traffic is terrible

Game 3 is definitely a must win. Get at least one and I'm confident the Knicks can close em out at home as they're a solid road team in the postseason. Of course I'd love to see a sweep, I just don't believe the Celtics are going to continue to shoot themselves out of leads and collapse in the fourth quarter. Not the entire series at least. They're bound to get one complete game.

Still we're in a good position, the longer this series goes on the worse it gets for Boston's players who have clearly been laboring at many points during this series already. 

Jrue showing his age and is a step slow. Same with Horford, and it's gonna get worse for him since Porzingis is apparently unable to play longer than five minutes at a time due to his illness. Brown's knee/hamstring has been affecting lift on shots, and his burst, exemplifying the issues with his handles and dribbling. Tatum's wrist also seems to be heavily impacting his shooting as of late.

The momentum swung heavily in our favor, but it's important to not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Even with Mikal's late game heroics, him not getting any points until the fourth quarter is pretty dreadful. Sorry, but it is what it is. He needs to stop driving just to take a midrange shot. It's a difficult and off balance shot and a waste of a possession when it can be much better served by at least getting a foul and going to the line. Not saying he has to remove the midrange game, just stop being afraid to actually drive on Horford's old ass.

KAT is also hardly getting any three point attempts in this series...playoffs in general. Any time he gets to share the floor with Mitch, or run with the bench, should be his opportunity to launch shots. KAT in drop or saying in or just outside the paint with Mitch present on the court doesn't make much sense.

I've loved these wins, but I just can't help but feel like we're still making things harder for ourselves when they don't have to be. As if Boston is bailing us out with all those bricked threes. Not gonna say we need to start launching more threes, but it's always gonna seem like we're intentionally playing with a hand tied behind our back by not taking three point shots Brunson and even Hart generate. Here's hoping OG, KAT, Mikal can get more consistent on their perimeter shooting throughout the course of the game instead of solely in the fourth quarter.",3,96790.0,1746810638.0,NYKnicks

mrg1e35,Fishmike52,shit like that is why I cant take the Thibs slander. It's not that he's the best.. he's really good. It's how far we have come. My god these kids don't know how lucky they are,3,81501.0,1746808974.0,NYKnicks

mrfxbgm,crototype,"Yeah, the discourse around this is silly. It fails to factor in so many variables. Luol Deng immediately got worse when he left Chicago. People rush to conclude he's been run into the ground. How about Thibs got the best out of him? Maybe other coaches didn't know how to use him best? Maybe he was a bad fit with his new teammates? 

The crazy part is that Deng eventually went back and played for Thibs again. You'd think he'd hate the man who apparently cut his career short.

Pretty sure a lot of the discourse around Thibs was fueled by Garpax out of Chicago. They got rid of him and made him a scapegoat. How'd firing him work out for them? Not good.",2,81303.0,1746807728.0,NYKnicks

mrg3o28,crototype,"In some people's opinion, it's a mortal lock that Johnny Bryant would come in and immediately take us to championship level. I don't know how anyone can be confident in that. Of course I'd support whatever new coach we bring in (if it comes to that). I just don't know how people can have these authoritative opinions about a complete unknown. Especially when the track record with Thibs is pretty much:
