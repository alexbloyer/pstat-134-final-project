mn6we0u,SongBig1162,"I have Fleming above Newell but that’s because I don’t think Newell can shoot (although watching Fleming throw bricks into the ocean the final 4.5 games there’s some definite question marks on his shooting still). But the thing about Fleming is that he suffers from the fact that he’s slow (not physically but in terms of quickly he processes information on the court). He’ll hesitate on moving the ball around on offense or he’ll be slow to rotate at times on defense. If Fleming was like an 18 or 19 year old this wouldn’t be that big of deal but he’s 21 and a 3rd year in college. It’s the whole reason why Jonathan Kuminga struggles with the Warriors.

mn6svu6,Arr0wmanc3r,"Rasheed Wallace is currently 50 years old. (To be clear, the above comment was edited since it started out saying ""Rasheer Wallace"". Just a lighthearted retort on my part.)

Edit: Snark aside, I assume you're talking about Rasheer Fleming. I think a lot of the +s for Asa are about his body and how he moves it - he's pretty agile for a probably 6'10"" guy and has great explosivity off the floor. Rasheer is a guy who does it more in the interior with his strength, and keep in mind that he's a Junior playing in college, guys in the NBA will be stronger and make that way harder. Obviously Fleming's other big positive is his shooting, which is way ahead of Asa. I think most indications point to him becoming a solid but not elite shooter, which combined with his size and defense makes a very obvious case for his floor to be the ever useful 3 and D forward archetype. The thing with Asa though is that his physical attributes are something that point to a higher ceiling - and teams, especially rebuilding ones, often like to go for the high ceiling guys in case they become Giannis v2.",4,126865.0,1744694989.0,ripcity

Only thing I'd add is you're not comparing apples to apples with Asa and Rasheer. If you compared them as freshmen or even at the same age (Rasheer is pretty young for a Jr) then Asa pretty clearly comes out on top. 


I think Rasheer has elite role player potential, if his processing improves. Asa is more of a question mark but there are pretty high level outcomes if he shoots it or gets a little better in PnRs. ",5,6201.0,1744697528.0,ripcity

It was, and IMO should still be, seen as a positive move from the trailblazers organization. Hart was on an expiring contract as an UFA (at least I think I remember it being unrestricted ) and almost definitely was not going to stick around in free agency. 

Essentially we got two bench players who both got playing time for the rest of that (lost) season, a late first round draft pick that we turned into a player who is currently a deep rotation player and has the potential (albeit the potential is shrinking instead of growing) to be an NBA rotation player, and a player widely seen as one of the best wing defenders in the NBA. 

What we gave up was a player almost certainly leaving in the off-season in free agency, a 2027 second round pick, a 2029 second round pick, and we had to drop ""Bouncin"" Greg Brown III",7,11124.0,1746723325.0,ripcity

I really like Hart, but also REALLY like Matisse, dude came back and looked like he had never even missed any time lol. D and 3P shooting were amazing right out of the gate. I like Murray too, especially more on the defensive side. Like Jabari Walker, he does a lot of little things well that doesn't show in his stats. If both of those 2 could get even to like 34ish% consistently it would really raise their value as role players. Walker shot 39% this year but super low volume.

But seriously, we have a bright future with an explosive core of young talent - especially Sharpe, Advija, Camara, Scoot, and Clingan. Simons may be on the trading block, but regardless he is also a very potent offensive threat. Tossing in Thybulle, Ayton, Blanton, and Grant only makes the salad better. Banton and Murray are also great contributors off the bench as was demonstrated in the last half of this season.

Coach Billups just had his current contract picked up for his fifth year option as well as a new contract for a guaranteed two years. Blazers fans vacillate wildly with a love/hate relationship with Chauncey Billups, but he's a great players coach and has done an admirable job this season with improved playmaking and rotations.

The Blazers front office and team in general projects a really healthy, happy culture. Our GM Joe Cronin has done a helluva job in getting the most out of trades and team assets. It was hard for Blazers fans to see Lillard being traded to Milwaukee but it freed up both parties to pursue sunnier pastures. Simons may be next to be traded - a literal protege of Lillard - and that will also be hard but Cronin will get the best value to help this young team build for the future. Cronin is a proven winner.

We have one of the best front offices in the league. We have amazing broadcasters both on TV and on radio. We have one of the best and most rabid fan bases in the NBA here in Rip City, and we're hungry to start winning again after several tanking seasons.

The best part? We have the [second youngest team in the NBA](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/por/sort/age/dir/desc/portland-trail-blazers) and they've already started to gel as a unit. The Thunder are the youngest team in the league and just won 68 games. We won 36 games which blew away the Vegas odds of between 21-25 predicted wins. We saw tantalizing glimpses of the potential this team has in the second half of this season: athletic, defensive-minded, and deeply talented. 

The future looks bright. It's a great time to jump on the Blazers bandwagon because our trajectory is finally aiming up...hopefully as high as this young man's unreal vertical.

>Think of Deni as a Luka who started out on very hard mode and decided to put more points into defense instead of offense.

>Shaedon Sharpe is exciting and waiting to break out.  His max ceiling is Michael Jordan, simply because he can just as high as Jordan (Kobe/Wade/SGA/Harden could not), his interior FG% is probably the highest in the NBA for a guard, and his mid-range FG% is almost the same as MJ....

>....*But* reality is that he is not likely to become MJ since his defense is subpar and he plays passively at times but that could just make him the T-Mac of the era or something.  

>Ideally, he hits 24-25ppg next season.

>Clingan is the Blazers version of Lively

********************************

>Similar to 2011, 1977 is Blazers championship year and holds a special spot.

***************************************************

>Portland has A LOT of ""What ifs""

>Could've had Michael Jordan but drafted Bowie.....also skipped out on Larry Bird, Dr. J, KD, and Moses Malone (the last one being drafted and traded away by Portland).  Basically, that's five Top 20 EVER guys that they skipped out on.  I don't know if any other team could say that.

>But it's not like Portland didn't draft great players, either.  If MVP Bill Walton was healthy, they probably win a few more rings.  If Arvydas Sabonis came into the NBA earlier, they probably win a few rings.  If Roy-Oden-Aldridge stayed healthy, they probably win a few rings.

>On top of that, Portland also has long histories of winning seasons on par with the Lakers, Celtics, and Spurs.  Thus, if Portland had that first ballot Hall of Fame superstar on top of those winning seasons, chances are likely they win rings like those franchises did.  So, yeah, good product out of Portland but bad luck.

mq8549x,thegaykid7,"It sucks whenever one's fate is removed from their hands due to circumstances outside of their control, but it's an inevitability of life. The fact that Pop is remaining in his role as Team President is a good sign that his health is at a place where he feels comfortable continuing in an important function. Here's to hoping it stays that way for years to come.


Although I have to wonder if we would've ever been able to give Pop a proper sendoff even without the health issues. After all, he doesn't seem like the type of guy who would do the whole farewell tour nonsense (*cough LeBron cough*), so would we have even realized game x would be his last game? Maybe his contract would've been expiring or maybe fans would've sensed the possible moment and showered him with love one last time just in case. It's a moot point now, but it does ease the sting just a little bit. Either way, I doubt Pop cares about any of that.


As sad as it is for us to have to say goodbye to him, though, I'm sadder that Pop won't be able to get one last taste of and shot at playoffs success. I know that isn't the be-all, end-all of everything, especially for someone like him---he has said those awful rebuilding years were some of the most enjoyable he's coached and helped to reinvigorate him---but it's still a shame nonetheless. Wemby and Pop, in the playoffs for one last series of rodeos...well, such is life. Real tragedy is all around us, every day and in many forms, so I'm just glad he's still with us.


Thanks for the memories, Pop. A great, humble man who always made the game bigger than basketball, and a great example of leadership in a world where we seem to be prioritizing all of the wrong traits in our chosen leaders.

Pop gave this team more than championships and trophies; he gave it an identity. He turned the Spurs into a team that is respected, reliable, and plays clean basketball. A team that never gets too cocky, learns from its mistakes, and made it a principle to ball out every time.

mqbo9tl,9thst_worker,"I have been a Spurs fan since I was 11 years old. I only know one coach for the San Antonio Spurs: that's Pop. No matter who steps in for Pop, whether it's Tim, Becky, Brett, or anyone else, Pop is always and will be the only Spurs coach in my heart. Pop demonstrated not only toughness in terms of coaching but also shared so much love and humanity with the players. I guess that's why so many people love him. Thank you, Pop. 

  
In term of the new coach, I really do not understand the decision. There are so many great coaches we can choose from. Taylor Jenkin, Miky Malone, Mike Brown, Mike Budenholzer... the list can keep going. Many of the coaches I mentioned earlier had relationship with the Spurs organization. Yes! Promoting Johnson is the easiest move, but is it the best move? In my opinion, Wendy, Fox, CP3, or even Castle is on a pretty tight timeline, in order for this group of great players to thrive, we need a better coach than Johnson.

Core Duties of an NBA Team President, as I understand it:

Sets the overall vision and direction of the team.

Works closely with ownership to align business and basketball goals.

May help develop long-term plans for winning championships, growing revenue, or expanding brand presence.

Supervises the general manager (GM) and supports major decisions like: Trades, free agency, and draft picks, Coaches, Player development

Not always involved in day-to-day player evaluations, but may weigh in on high-level roster construction.

Bridges ownership, basketball ops, and business ops (marketing, ticket sales, etc.).

Helps set and maintain the team’s culture and identity.

Involved in hiring senior staff and setting department goals.",1,362.0,1746201496.0,NBASpurs

mq9mw1r,xnoob69,"I get that Tim Duncan was the cornerstone of the Spurs dynasty, and there’s no denying his impact. But to say Pop couldn’t have won without him underestimates just how elite Popovich is as a coach.

Pop isn’t just a guy who lucked into a generational big man, he built a system that emphasized ball movement, defense, and team culture. That system made stars out of Parker, Ginóbili, and later Kawhi. Look at how he adapted over the years, from post-heavy sets around Duncan to positionless, three-heavy offenses in the 2010s. Few coaches evolve like that.

Also, Pop was instrumental in developing Duncan. Who’s to say he couldn’t have done the same with another high-level talent? You give Pop someone like Kevin Garnett or Dirk early on, and I’d bet he still ends up with rings. Maybe not five, maybe not as early, but championships? Absolutely still possible.

At the end of the day, great players and great coaches amplify each other. Pop without Duncan wouldn’t be the same, but to say he couldn’t have won at all? That’s selling him short.",2,3522.0,1746220551.0,NBASpurs

> In addition, the 20-year-old is the only rookie since 2017-18 to record a game with 30+ points, a game with 15+ rebounds and a game with 14+ assists in the same season. On Feb. 7. he scored a season-high 33 points off the bench at Charlotte, the most by a rookie reserve in Spurs history and became just the seventh Spurs rookie to post a 30-point game. On March 21, Castle logged 17 points, 14 assists, 5 rebounds, 3 steals and 1 block in a win vs. Philadelphia. On April 2, he had a 15-point, 15-rebound and 9-assist game in a win at Denver followed by a near triple-double with 22 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds in Cleveland on April 4.
>
> San Antonio selected Castle with the fourth overall pick of the 2024 NBA Draft. With this award, the Spurs have drafted the most Rookie of the Year winners since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976, and is the first team since the merger to select consecutive Rookie of the Year winners without having two No. 1 overall picks.",20,362.0,1745976176.0,NBASpurs

He also plays like a vet. Maybe he won't have the best game some nights but he doesn't seem timid or afraid of big moments. And while he's confident, he's not overtly cocky or obnoxious about himself.

But sochan is very switchable and can guard some centers if a switch occurs. Again, nothing wrong with him playing heavy minutes but 2 non shooting guards just doesn’t really work today.

I was there last year for the Nembhard shot.

Brunson had just gotten a steal and couldn’t dunk it so he switched it to a lay in. Knicks fans had taken over the arena chanting “MVP.” I’m dying laughing, a few drinks in, because he couldn’t dunk it and the Knicks fans next to us were legit getting mad because I said **”I** can jump higher than that.” We won that game and to this day that shot was the most insane I’ve ever seen one place go. The NY fans weren’t very talkative after.

The next day I’m at sweetgreen eating a salad outside in Indy (I’m a resident) with my fiancé and dog- with my Haliburton jersey on. Some more NY fans drive by screeching “Knicks in 6,” at me. I rolled my eyes and waved them on. A woman with her small daughter defended my honor though  by saying “Nuh uh, no way” a bunch of times.

We sat in section 20 and behind us was a group of Knicks fans, like 8-10 altogether, and they were talking their shit talk for about 10 minutes and had totally left mid-way thru the 3rd quarter.

mrfu0wg,Petey_Wheatstraw_MD,"My best memory is also my first memory as a Pacers fan.

I was 10 years old, had just moved to Indy and didn’t know anybody. I started talking to some kid on my dad’s club football team because he was also new to the area and neither of us had any friends. He mentioned how his dad had an extra ticket to the Pacers game and asked me if I wanted to go. I was just excited to go and possibly make my first friend, that I didn’t even ask who they were playing.

Turns out it was against the Bulls coming off their 2nd championship in a row, led by the most famous person on the planet at the time. This was the infamous game where Reggie and MJ got into a fight and were both disqualified. 

It was like the coolest thing in the world to a 10 year old who had never been to a pro sports game. I became a lifelong Pacers fan after that, and 32 years later, that kid is still my best friend.

mrgjuqg,Newfie-Decker,"My favorite pacers moment was when Reggie nailed that 3 over MJ. I'm from small town east coast Canada, and basketball was never really that big there, hockey rules supreme, even I ""hated"" basketball. Couldn't tell you why, just did because that's what most of the people did. A few kids from school spoke about basketball and it was fun playing it, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I started watching a bit, and this Jordan guy was the one to watch. For lack of better words, I've always been a fan of the different. I liked different music than everyone, I liked different cartoons and shows than all my friends. Hell, I even liked a hockey team that no one cheered for (geographically the team that was the furthest away from me). So when I was watching the game against the pacers, and I could feel it washing over me.... Small market team, not a lot of publicity, and they had this guy that people really didn't like.... This is probably gonna be my team.... I watched in pure excitement and agony all in one. The clock is ticking down, things can happen with so little time, I'm on the edge of the couch and don't even realize it, Reggie comes off the screen, catches the ball, elevates and shoots..... I don't even realize it, I'm standing, a foot away from the TV, hands on my head.... As the ball enters the hoop, BOOM BABY! I'm a full blown Pacer fan! I'm cheering super loud, my parents come running to see what the commotion is, and I'm jumping up and down yelling he made it he made it! He made what? they asked with huge eyes. That shot, he made it!  That Miller guy, he made that shot. My parents are baffled at me, they shake their heads and leave the room. But it was that moment, that one basket that made me a Pacer Fan. Years later in my adult life, I made a trip to Indianapolis so I could take in a Pacer game live. I loved it, and want to do it again. It's nice remembering that moment, thanks for asking that, and having this giveaway! Good luck to everyone!",1,2185.0,1746814523.0,pacers

mrfmd9f,reidhoch,"> Steve Prohm was the head coach at Iowa State and coached Tyrese Haliburton for two seasons from 2018-2020.

> The first thing that strikes people about Tyrese is his ability to interact with anyone. His charisma. I was no different.

> When I was the head coach at Iowa State, I went to Las Vegas in the summer to watch him play in a tournament. One of my assistant coaches had a relationship with Tyrese, but this was my first time watching him in person.

> I don’t think he ran up and down the floor more than three times before my assistant coach and I looked at each other like: We need this kid.

> He could shoot, he could pass, but it was so much more than his basketball ability. I watched his mannerisms. I watched his personality. I watched his communication. I even watched the way he interacted with the refs. He was talking with them, but he wasn’t pissing them off. He almost had a bond with them. Then he was off talking with teammates or his coaches. He just had such a presence.

> I believe the face of your team, your leader, has to connect with people and the community. I knew then he could do that.

> Another sign of a great leader is humility. Tyrese had that when he came in the door.

> Before his freshman season, we had a reunion with former players. The final night, we were out at a sports bar in town, talking. He looked at me across the table and said, “Coach, this thing was awesome. This is why I wanted to come to Iowa State. I wanted to be around all these former players. I wanted to be around greatness.”

> That showed humility.

> We had a good team his freshman year. I remember his dad, John, told him: “Find the best older player that has a routine and understands how to work and get with him and learn how to work every single day.”

> For us that season, that player was Marial Shayok, a fifth-year senior. Tyrese kept his eyes on everything Marial did that year, and because of that, I think he learned how to really work at the highest level. That, too, showed humility.

> Early on in Tyrese’s freshman season, an NBA scout came to one of our practices. We practiced for an hour or two, and when we were winding down, the scout called me over.

> “You know who your highest draft pick is going to be?” he asked me.

> I didn’t know. We had Shayok and Talen Horton-Tucker, another freshman who was a big-time recruit. I thought the scout could have been talking about several guys.

> “Tyrese Haliburton,” he said.

> “Really?” I said. “Tell me why.”

> Tyrese had maybe played a total of 10 or 11 games at that point. “Man, I’ve watched him all practice,” the scout said. “He resonates with the older guys. He listens to everything they say. He fits into everything you’re doing. He takes coaching. His presence and demeanor are always positive, he always has energy. He’ll be your highest draft pick.”

> It’s a good reminder: People are always watching.

> Tyrese’s personality, his smile, his demeanor allowed him to connect with anybody from any walk of life. Because of his presence, because of his personality, he empowered other guys to be better.

> After Tyrese’s freshman year, I met with him to talk about his future. He had some NBA interest, and I wanted to see what he wanted to do. It was the easiest talk. He already had a plan.

> “I’m coming back to school,” he told me. “I don’t need to go through all these workouts. I need to get here and get bigger, stronger and better. Next year, if I’m a lottery pick, I’m going to leave.”

> That summer, he played for the United States at the FIBA Under-19 World Cup. He came back for his sophomore year with another level of confidence.

> He was one of the guys who came to the gym or office every day with a smile and personality. You always knew he was there. You could always hear him.

> He was just so positive, and his energy was contagious. That was one of his biggest traits as a leader. He kept everybody fresh and excited.

> During his sophomore season, however, he broke his wrist. He sat out for a little while and tried to come back and then hurt it again. It just wasn’t smart for him to keep playing. He needed surgery.

> We knew then he was going to be a lottery pick. A lot of guys would have left school and gone to get ready for the draft on their own, so he and I met again to talk it out. It was also an easy conversation: He was headed for the NBA Draft, but he wasn’t leaving the team.

> “Coach, I’m going to be at every practice,” he said. “I’m going to be at every game. I’m not going nowhere. We’re gonna finish this thing out together.”

> His mom, Brenda, still came to every game. Tyrese was as animated and into it, with a cast on his hand, as when he was playing. He understood that it was more than just about him. He knew it was important that he was still a connector.

> Two months ago, I got let go from Murray State. Right around that time, Tyrese hit a game-winner against the Milwaukee Bucks. The next day, I was in the school pickup line to get my 10-year-old. My phone rang. It was Tyrese.

> He told me: “Hey, Coach, I just wanted to check in on you. I just wanted to make sure you know I’m thinking about it. If you need anything, let me know.”

> When you get fired, your whole family goes through it. For my kids to hear him on the phone and think, “You know what? My dad’s done all right,” that helped in my recovery.

> That’s what the great ones do. When they know people are down, they lift them up. That’s leadership.

> — As told to Jayson Jenks",49,3127.0,1746804391.0,pacers

mrdd657,Teambooler24," Couldn’t agree more, these are my thoughts, sorry may be long 

One, booker had a “down” year and had 26,7,4, one of the reasons his shooting splits and stuff is down is because due to the suns really poor roster he had to play an out of position at point guard, I know they had tyus but tyus literally was just a spot up shooter, Devin Booker was initiating the offense and being the primary playmaker which he has become good at but not what makes him elite 

What makes Devin Booker elite is as on off scorer, he’s one the best in the world off the catch and using movement, whether that’s coming off a dribble handoff into a one dribble pull off, working off down screens and pin downs and similar actions he’s one of the absolute best, and one of the best half court shot creators in all of basketball 

If he was in Houston we use a heavy dribble handoff offense, you’d utilize booker and sengun similar to how Murray and jokic work, Booker plays better as a true shooting guard when you have a point guard that can set up things, which is what Fred will do ( I’d bring him back on a deal around 25-30 mil ) and that will allow amen to ease into that point forward role with little pressure as he blossoms into the alpha superstar I believe he will be, amens cutting helps booker a ton and bookers gravity on off ball actions gives amen more room to drive, and senguns playmaking as a center helps even more 

When the suns inevitably call for Durant, everytime I low ball the hell out of them, and when they counter decline, but say “ if you offer booker we have Jalen, cam, tari or Bari and your picks “ you hope that the package they get for Durant is so bad booker just doesn’t see a path for them to retool and they trade him 

I know seeing tari or Bari, not both, in the trade is a lot for some people but we will have to trade one to stay under the second apron in a few years anyways, so we need to consolidate, and use the roster spot on a good value 3 point shooter that hopefully can defend and on good value 

Go into next year with Fred/booker/amen/brooks/sengun
Reed/3 and d guy/ tari or bari/adams, and additional depth to fill out the roster, that team is ready to compete imo ",4,15957.0,1746766703.0,rockets

* It means you can keep two of Amen/Booker/Sengun out on the floor at all times, which would significantly improve our offense over the course of an entire game.
* More playmakers also just makes your offense more unpredictable and harder to stop as multiple players can score and create for others.
* Booker is also a great off-ball player who you can run off-ball screens for to get his shots, so that allows you to keep the ball in Amen and Sengun's hands more during those actions.
* I also think Booker could make a very nice two-man game with Sengun similar to Murray/Jokic. You need a smart playmaker for that type of two man game who can hit tough jumpers, and that fits Booker perfectly. I can't imagine Jaylen being able to play off Sengun well like that.

I'm sure Jaylen would be good as well, but I always prefer offensive options who have the ability to score and playmake at a high level as I think those guys are much more difficult to shut out of a game.",3,64350.0,1746802528.0,rockets

It is so fucking funny to see republicans try and make a budget lol

The fiscal hardliners are like “we need 1.5 trillion in spending cuts if we’re gonna cut taxes” and then the moderates are like “that much doesn’t exist unless we commit suicide politically by cutting Medicaid and then the hardliners are like “what if we do a sneaky Medicaid cut that still causes people to lose coverage?” And then the moderates are like “we’re still gonna get exploded in the midterm” and then the weird right wing populists that are anti rich guy but still republicans because they support the ethnostate “what if we raise taxes on the rich to pay for it?” Then they get laughed out of the room

It’s just so fucking funny that they do all this work just to get to the obvious conclusion that there’s not enough spending to cut without legit killing people and that the only way they can afford to take the burden off of poor people is to become economic leftists lol",6,215192.0,1746812993.0,denvernuggets

He told that story shortly after the draft, again (to the same people) during a training camp presser, and then again in a 1-1 interview with Kay Adams for her podcast. It was the same exact story each time. On the podcast Kay tried to tell him ""we know this, tell me something new,"" and he just kept telling the story lol

It's probably calculated tbh. He talks so much but rarely says anything, so in a way he's a lot like Belichick (they're both Parcells guys too so that makes sense)",2,445439.0,1746805181.0,denvernuggets

It's possible I'm remembering the hustle plays more than other moments because I was there in person - since the crowd got really into it whenever there was a hustle play, those plays might have stuck with me more. I thought the Wolves hustled a lot...

Donte and Naz were diving for balls (Naz even hurt himself by throwing his body on the floor at one point), Wolves players sprinted to save the ball when it was going out of bounds several times, forced turnovers, shotclock violations etc. Whenever Warriors went on a run, Wolves consistently responded with their own run usually due to defense. Before garbage time, Wolves had more rebounds as well. Mike Conley was chasing Hield all over. All these things are the definition of hustle.

 I'm curious why other people interpreted their play as a bad game and being out-hustled. They were missing layups and it wasn't their best offense sure, but how are people accusing their hustle, defense and effort? I thought effort and defense was one of the best parts of that game 😂 But I naturally tend to focus on defense more and was there live, so maybe I missed stuff or am selectively remembering plays.

Felt like a B game from the Wolves and they still won big, which is nice. Would really like to see Ant and Rudy get going more on offense though

Shoutout to the bench, especially NAW. This team is going to be very hard to beat if they can hit those shots. I was a little worried about NAW since he’s had a poor start to the playoffs; hopefully now he has the monkey off his back.

The Warriors sub seems surprisingly optimistic. It seems like most think Kerr conceded the game and just wanted to see who’s playable and who’s not. I think there’s some truth to that, but if Curry remains out, I don’t know if there’s a combination of players that can get them to win games here.

mrfk8a4,DeanEvasonPunch,">Genuine question - why does the sub feel the Wolves were ""out hustled last night by a large margin""?

The simplest answer is because SVG said it on the broadcast a few times. So that sticks in people's minds.

More specifically though, they are still giving up some uncontested wide open backdoor cuts on defense due to lack of communication or rotation. And they've given up a few one pass transition baskets after scores because they didn't get back and get set on defense.",2,34307.0,1746803740.0,timberwolves

Absolutely love the player he's become over the year. Exactly what we wanted out of him, somebody who can get tough buckets when nobody else can score, and drive and kick to the open guys. 

Not saying he's better than KAT but I'll also say I don't think we ever lose because of him but the same can't be said for kat. Kat would routinely throw games where as Randle is just consistently a dawg with a lower ceiling

It has always been nuts to me that these fanbases act like huge rivals. Fights at games between 9ers and Rams/Giants and Dodgers/Lakers and Warriors. And yet, pretty much every one of these fanbases has that huge contingent that fulfills the stereotype of people who will just gravitate to the other CA team when it's doing well. When I was a kid in the gateway cities (East LA county), a bunch of people abandoned the Dodgers for the Giants. A decade later, they all adopted the 9ers because they were good. The last time I visited home a year ago, I saw A LOT of 49er stuff and Warriors stuff in SoCal. Until Lebron got traded to LA, pretty sure the Warriors were the NBA team for all of CA.

-We're not trading Bam or Tyler.

-He's talking about retooling. 

-Tyler deserves a max extension and Pat's talked about it with him.  Tyler isn't in a rush and they both seem to be on the same page. 

-Pat says personnell and philosophy changes need to happen after flaming out so badly against the Cavs. 

-He wants to avoid the repeater tax. We'll probably try to reset it over the next two seasons. 

-When asked about star player ages and timelines, Pat is looking at teams like the Warriors to pair aging vets with younger players. Seems like he's not against bringing in someone like Durant to pair with Bam and Tyler.",8,313836.0,1746811699.0,heat

The disappointing thing for me about Tatum is that I could actively see that he listened to all of the criticism from last game about the 3s. For the most part I believe he’s done a great job tuning out the criticism but this is the first time in the NBA I could see it so clearly. He was turning down shots I’ve seen him take all season which you can’t do because they just sit on your drives. Honestly wouldn’t be mad if he came out next game and put up a bunch of 3s. I don’t care if you miss if it’s the right read. If they’re playing drop shoot it. Just eliminate the step back unless you got it going and I’m good. 

Also I don’t think he should be matched up on KAT at all. I think having to box out the other team’s center is hard and he’s the leading rebounder on the team. Seems insignificant but not having the advantage of leaking out to get yourself some easy buckets on transition makes things tough and you’re running the full length of the court every possession which can take away your legs for shooting. Probably part of the reason he looked so good in the Orlando series was less defensive load.

The other big change seems to be the ability for the team to bounce back and respond. They have always had random stinkers, but they never did it twice in a row. That’s partly why the horrible stretch over the winter was scary. They couldn’t snap out of it. And here we are doing it again at the worst moment. I was worried all game last night because even when we racked up a 20 pt lead, we were shooting horribly. Like 35-38%.

Saying the rest of the team isn’t playing up to standards isn’t some sort of crazy take or anything…. NY defense has been a lot better than people are giving it credit for. That said I blame the coaching for what we are seeing. No direction or leadership to get the Jays on track. If you see Tatum settling for 3’s as a coach how is that not a point of emphasis? How do you not call timeouts when needed? How is your last play of the game to hope a semi transition bucket works again? I see Kerr setup actions to get his guys open and it feels like we need more of that from Joe and haven’t gotten it. We drove more in the second game but are scared to attack still because of NY semi help. They need to be decisive and make plays like we have all season. A coach is the one who should be telling all this to the players and getting them committed to the game plan.

Obviously Knick fans were very frustrated as you all creamed us 4x and that's putting it nicely.

  
The Detroit series showed that Bridges/Towns both have ""playoff gears"" they didnt show in the regular season. They are NOT soft.

Mitch is finally healthy and doing Mitch things.

McBride waking up is a big problem for Boston. We have a very weak bench so getting big play from Mitch/McBride is huge for the Knicks.

JT shot under 40% overall - there is no way a Finals MVP will have that statistic.  I'm not sure if Steph shot under 40 the year Iggy took it, but when a guy has 1 or 2 bad games in at most a 7 game series, they aren't taking the Russel trophy.

JB needs to recognize his own weaknesses and avoid them.  His dribble drive turnovers are getting very cringe.  It's no secret to just do a quick double on him and the ball is gone.  I call this a lead by example type behavior.  Players **aren't** going to listen to him, if he sets bad examples himself.

JT/JB have never seemed to be that ""it"" go to guy that so many other NBA stars seem to be.  It doesn't mean those ""it"" guys have anything close to 100% success rate.  But you can see it, they want the ball, they want to put on their move and they have confidence.  JT/JB last second shot is always some low percentage, off balance shot that we pray goes in.  The team wins because collectively, when healthy, they out talent any other NBA roster.

Maybe there’s some genius actions we can run to try and clear some space, I’m definitely not smart enough to know what they are.

mquqppg,ahmed_a20,"The Giddey contract situation is very interesting and I’m a lot more torn on it than I had originally thought I would be. A few months ago I would’ve refused to even consider resigning him, then by the end of the season I was happy to have him stay for no more than 25 mil a year over 3 or 4 years. But after thinking about it more I can agree to some extent with the people that believe he should be getting 30+ million a year. But it all depends on context.

Giddey is not a guy that will be a top 10 player in the NBA, neither will he be of the two or maybe even 3 most important players on a championship or contending team. But he definitely will be an elite supporting cast guy or role player in that scenario. With that in mind, if the Bulls somehow want to compete immediately and trade for guys like Zion or Gianni’s and bring in Myles Turner in FA, Giddey shouldn’t be receiving anymore than like 22 million a year, because he won’t be at the top of the list of most crucial players in that case and it would give the bulls more flexibility to make the necessary moves to improve the roster to compete. If he’s serious about winning, he would accept.

Now if the Bulls are finally going to accept who they are and just bottom out for a few years, Giddey can get paid whatever the hell it is he wants for however long the bulls plan on tanking. Because in this scenario Giddey is arguably the most important player on the team, at least for the first two season of the tank, or until we get a top draft pick that conveys into a generational talent. By the time the bulls builds this young team of top draft prospects to a point of playoff and even championship contention, you can then revisit Giddey’s contract and cut it down to accommodate for all the other people on the team.",0,25942.0,1746521189.0,chicagobulls

How would you go if you had 10,000 co workers abusing you? Taking the human side here I am giving him a pass as post January have seen someone who cares, wants to be here, wants to prove people wrong, he doesn’t like losing and most importantly I saw someone that wants to improve on defence.

Look he was injured the last month, liked his competitive spirit against Lakers, Denver who were trying to win. Miami’s coach is just quality…clamp down Coby main outlet for Bulls to score. Giddey has one arm be physical hurt him.1st quarter defence poor but I thought 25 points working away when your best shooter has been taken out I was a bit surprised…

His defence in Nov, Dec really had me questioning the trade but his effort was pretty good post Jan. Really hope we trade up to get Queen or the Duke big man as we need defence and young players to grow together. Main thing I like is Giddey knows his weaknesses and seems to be committed to try and improve. I also think Chicago made the trade not believing that Lonzo would make it back. Giddey thought he was PG, Coby and Ayo didn’t want to give PG up.

I think we need to talk to the Hornets around what incremental improvements they will give us in FRP or pick swaps in a Lonzo trade for that expiring Suns offcast (expiring).

Giddey is not a franchise player.

Giddey is not a no 1 option 

But he is a table setter,  elite defensive rebounder, elite passer, high iq, improved defender but needs to continue to work. If we get him for $28m for 4 years he’s not perfect but it is one of the few AK deals where history will prove them right.

They then immediately tried to accelerate the rebuild by bringing in Josh Smith and Brandon Jennings (if they properly rebuilt they might’ve ended up in a better position)

But they kept building on that and finally ended up in the playoffs with Reggie Jackson, Drummond and Tobias Harris. That team was built to be mediocre, then they continued to hover around the 8th - 10th seed for the next few years (sound familiar?) even after trading for Blake Griffin.

Only after they actually started a proper tank, with some painful basketball and terrible draft luck outside of 2021 I’ll admit, did they end up in a playoff position that looks sustainable.

Plus since Vooch is on an expiring deal they can try one more run next season with him to see if it works and if not that's around the time most of their core are coming off their contracts so they can just let everyone retire or walk and restart a rebuild with the few young guys they have.

They don’t have to technically resign Giddy until after they make moves in free agency, trades  and even the draft as long as they don’t exceed the cap. 

If they exceed the cap they have to work under the rules of the 1st apron.

this team absolutely can gut itself properly and tank if it wants to while maintaining young players worth having, but hey ig sticking onto high end role players to keep the team in purgatory for another 5 years is more fun.",1,8923.0,1746593673.0,chicagobulls
mr0navp,DisMFer,"I mean it is objectively more fun to have a .500 team than a tanking team. That's the part I find eye-rolling. Everyone here demanding a tank would 100% not watch the team if they did tank. I will never believe you if you say otherwise. 

Go to any sub for any team deep in a tank. Their game threads have like 12 people who stop posting by halftime. 

Yes a tank is smart teambuilding, but the thing that makes the current Bulls different from OKC, the Cavs, the Magic, and the Rockets is that they had high-level stars that teams were willing to give up multiple assets for to get. OKC didn't just tank, they tanked after trading Russ and PG. The Rockets traded Russ and Harden for picks. The Magic had Vooch and Aaron Gordon. The Cavs are about the only team that just lost guys and had to rebuild from scratch and it took nearly a decade and again, they didn't draft Donovan or Allen or Strus. 

At best trading Vooch and Zo gets us zero return. Trading Coby and Josh (who is currently not under contract so that'd have to be a sign and trade so good luck on that one) is maybe two highly protected firsts. So we trade them and get to watch them be all-stars on other teams while we sit around for 10 years hoping that this time the guy we draft in the top 4 works out? Getting hyped for one 20 year old after another before waiting 3 seasons, deciding they're ""high end role players"" and trading them so we can bottom out again?",0,104361.0,1746594951.0,chicagobulls

I’d rather watch a team tank for a few years and then develop into a real playoff powerhouse compared to whatever the fuck the bulls and kings have been doing the past decade. But then again, fans will continue watching playin teams regardless so the owners will never greenlight a tank in response. 

A core led by Coby and Josh isn’t gonna lead the team anywhere, but keep falling in love w March basketball extraordinaires and perennial playin. they won’t be all stars on other team, and that’s why this team and its fans keep getting tricked into the same cycle of poverty lol",2,8923.0,1746595454.0,chicagobulls

mrg6w16,kidkuro,"Long one since traffic is terrible

Game 3 is definitely a must win. Get at least one and I'm confident the Knicks can close em out at home as they're a solid road team in the postseason. Of course I'd love to see a sweep, I just don't believe the Celtics are going to continue to shoot themselves out of leads and collapse in the fourth quarter. Not the entire series at least. They're bound to get one complete game.

Still we're in a good position, the longer this series goes on the worse it gets for Boston's players who have clearly been laboring at many points during this series already. 

Jrue showing his age and is a step slow. Same with Horford, and it's gonna get worse for him since Porzingis is apparently unable to play longer than five minutes at a time due to his illness. Brown's knee/hamstring has been affecting lift on shots, and his burst, exemplifying the issues with his handles and dribbling. Tatum's wrist also seems to be heavily impacting his shooting as of late.

The momentum swung heavily in our favor, but it's important to not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Even with Mikal's late game heroics, him not getting any points until the fourth quarter is pretty dreadful. Sorry, but it is what it is. He needs to stop driving just to take a midrange shot. It's a difficult and off balance shot and a waste of a possession when it can be much better served by at least getting a foul and going to the line. Not saying he has to remove the midrange game, just stop being afraid to actually drive on Horford's old ass.

KAT is also hardly getting any three point attempts in this series...playoffs in general. Any time he gets to share the floor with Mitch, or run with the bench, should be his opportunity to launch shots. KAT in drop or saying in or just outside the paint with Mitch present on the court doesn't make much sense.

I've loved these wins, but I just can't help but feel like we're still making things harder for ourselves when they don't have to be. As if Boston is bailing us out with all those bricked threes. Not gonna say we need to start launching more threes, but it's always gonna seem like we're intentionally playing with a hand tied behind our back by not taking three point shots Brunson and even Hart generate. Here's hoping OG, KAT, Mikal can get more consistent on their perimeter shooting throughout the course of the game instead of solely in the fourth quarter.",3,96790.0,1746810638.0,NYKnicks

mn1wq5w,IamOlderthanMe,"It all depends on the draft lottery.

Whether we can have hope this offseason in progressive moves or we wallow in misery for another season, it all depends on the draft lottery.

- Cooper
- Dylan
- VJ

We can make deck chair moves like moving our expirings for underwhelming prospects, but if we hit big in the lottery, our franchise's fate changes forever.

Some of the deck chair moves that I would like:

- Betting on underwhelming prospects. 

Jaime Jacquez Jr has been in the Heat doghouse for multiple reasons, rumored to be dogging Spo's ex wife. There is a small, small chance that the Heat may be open to trading him. I believe he is the connecting player that we need on the wing. His 3PT issues can be solved in our 3PT healthy system.

Jonathan Kuminga. A lot of problems and will be extremely expensive. But the Dubs obviously are not prioritizing him for their stretch run for Steph's final hurrah. Perhaps we can get him for cheap (but he will be expensive to pay). I personally do not like this idea fully because of how expensive he would be.

Patrick Williams. One of the most underwhelming prospects in the league that is being overpaid. But we can get him for Nurkic expiring and a SRP or two. Could be valuable in a new system.

- Moving on from Miles Bridges and Mark Williams

Miles is our healthiest player. Besides LaMelo and Brandon, Miles has the most trade value. He is on a team friendly deal and he has not done anything terribly abhorrent in a year. Yes, he is a terrible person, but a team can trade for him and obtain great value. We could then shore up that spot with a draft pick or a veteran role player that is cheaper.

Mark Williams' problems have been aired out by Rob Pelinka and the Lakers crew. Mark is beloved here, but because of his health issues, trading him may be the best option. Mark showcased his health toward the end of the season. Maybe some team will bite. Otherwise, I dont mind keeping Mark for another year and showcasing his skills for another prospect of a trade.",-3,984994.0,1744634676.0,CharlotteHornets

mn3i7tu,a_moniker,"It’s a bit tough because most players who are as raw as Salaün aren’t actually given NBA minutes until later in their career. Their minutes also vary wildly, so I’ll use per 36 numbers and effective field goal percentages in order to try to standardize them a bit more accurately. 

**Here is Salaün’s per 36 minute stats:**

- 10.2/8.1/2.1 per 36 on 41.4 eFG% over 60 games

**Here are some other good to great players with bad rookie seasons:**

- Jimmy Butler averaged 10.9/5.6/1.4 per 36 on 41.8 eFG% over 42 games
- Dirk Notwizki averaged 14.5/6.1/1.8 per 36 on 42.6 eFG% percent shooting over 47 games
- Giannis averaged 10.0/6.4/2.8 per 36 on 46.3 eFG% over 77 games
- Jordan Poole averaged 14.2/3.3/3.8 per 36 on 40.6 eFG% over 57 games
- Jonathan Isaac averaged 9.7/6.6/1.2 per 36 on 43.5 eFG% over 27 games
- Pascal Siakam averaged 9.6/7.8/0.7 per 36 on 50.5 eFG% over 55 games
- Aaron Gordon averaged 11.0/7.6/1.5 per 36 on 47.8 eFG% over 47 games

Those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head, which is why it skews more towards star level players despite the fact that Salaün is almost certainly not gonna reach that level. I’m certain there are a bunch of worse rookies that turned into decent rotation guys that I just can’t think of right now. Of course, it’s also important to keep in mind that a lot of those names listed above came into the league older and more experienced than Salaün. 

Overall, Salaün’s play this season definitely wasn’t promising, but it also doesn’t mean he has no hope of becoming a solid player. Of the names listed above, Jonathan Isaac is probably the most comparable player/archetype that, personally, comes to mind. The pick would be well worth it if Salaün could turn into a healthy (and non-crazy) version of Isaac’s in the future.",6,119172.0,1744652792.0,CharlotteHornets

I'm not saying the dude is going to turn into Giannis, but Giannis' rookie season wasn't good and people were also questioning that pick as well. All we need is for Salaun to just not be a liability. If he can come off the bench for 15 minutes a game and not embarrass himself next year then he'll be fine.",4,42277.0,1744738300.0,CharlotteHornets

mn3x0zf,TheMuleB,"Not much roster-wise, but the fact that the FO has been making smart moves ever since acquiring the team is making me quite optimistic, even if not necessarily for next season.

We've been taking on bad contracts in exchange for draft picks, have been trying out different G-Leaguers all season instead of sticking with known bad players which has already lead to one success story and a half (Moussa & Baugh), we've made no stupid short-term win-now moves like we were accustomed to in the past (e.g. the Hayward contract), and they've already announced that they'll be making a bunch of investments including building a new practice facility which was long overdue.

These are the kind of moves smart teams make, and is a huge step up from the MJ years where we were selling draft picks for cash. Our roster is still pretty horrible so I don't expect any miracles for next season, but I'm quite hopeful that we'll turn this around in due time if they keep this up. The results haven't been there so far, but I'm quite pleased with the process, and in the end that's the only thing you can control. The only concern I have is with the drafting since the Salaün pick is not looking good so far, but obviously you can't judge a GM off of just one pick, so I'm still in wait-and-see mode.",7,13496.0,1744657186.0,CharlotteHornets

mn4l5xg,Giddf,"You can't extrapolate per 36 stats and efg% for dudes that played their rookie years in completely different eras, styles of play, different roles, and different amounts of opportunity. And use that as a point of comparison.

Jimmy Butler averaged 8mpg his rookie year. His per 36 stats are meaningless. Poole is a small guard. Dirk played his rookie year over 25 years ago when the style of play and level of offensive efficiency was completely different. You are right in that Jonathan Isaac is the best comparison to Tidjane on this list but you leave off the fact that Isaac had a 3 times higher steal rate and a over 4 times higher block rate than Salaun. Which clearly sets him apart.

If you want to standardize stats you don't use per 36 either. You use per poss. To normalize for pace. And TS% is a greater indicator for someones scoring efficiency because it accounts for fts drawn+made whereas efg% doesn't.

Tidjanes closest comparisons in my opinion are Sekou Doumbouya, Kevin Knox, and Poku. All taller off-ball forwards/bigs that have similar shot diets. All received around 20mpg+ their rookie years in a solid sample of games. And all played in the same modern era of space and pace basketball. They have the same below average efficiency from both 2pters and 3pters. Well below 50% TS. Similar ft rates. Low point production. Low or unspectacular stock production. 3/4 of them including Salaun have an ast% below 10. And all of them have a higher tov% than ast%. All of them except for Knox have lower usage rates (<20%) as well. With Tidjane having the lowest usage rate of the four. The only statistical category he ranks in the best of these 4 players is his rebounding.

Booker can veto a trade but the suns are also completely trash from top to bottom and our reputation has gone up some since the lakers were shown to be the problem in the Mark Williams trade.

We've already been linked to Giannis and as long as Booker gets paid I really don't think he cares too much where he's playing so long as that team isn't completely dysfunctional which is really only a couple of organizations, Washington being the biggest offender along with the Kings.  

My username may be a joke on who Luka spanked Devin in the playoffs and ""sonned"" him but the guy is legit one of the best teammates in the league (as per how he played in the Olympics in giving up his ego to do what was best for the team and we need more guys like that here) along with offensively being one of the best scorers in the league and that isn't even subjective.  Pairing him next to Melo would make us a legit playoff team when healthy and Devin can bridge the gap between himself and Melo because he's only 28 so he still is within our timeline.

After watching the first round play out, I’m curious who people would take with the 3rd or 4th pick this year.

At 4th, Edgecombe may have a higher ceiling than Tre Johnson, but Tre’s shooting would likely plug into our line up much faster than VJ’s slashing.

So besides the 3&D, why would the Raptors pick him if they land at 7? They're not in the Spurs' situation where they have the luxury of having multiple first rounders and a generational talent in Wemby + Fox/Castle sitting around where Carter seamlessly fits into the lineup and can start eating up minutes. The Raptors have a dire need of on-ball creation. They're either dead last or at the very least near the bottom in isolation, PnR, and off the dribble shooting metrics. Poeltl had the best on/off metrics on the team because any option at the 5 beside him is costing the team points every time they're on the court. 

Needs aside, the Raptors may not even be in a position to be looking at needs. With a lack of star potential on the team, BPA probably is the way to go. I don't see Bryant being BPA over other players who would likely still be on the board by then.",4,10947.0,1746473068.0,torontoraptors

mrg4hul,MInkton,"Totally agree. 

People saying the Ingram trade was a bad one done understand talent acquisition, and the rare opportunity where we get a borderline allstar without giving up our picks(gave a shitty first)/starters/young talent. Also, they knew he wouldnt play so we could still tank (fuck you Philly, Utah, Nets, shamelessly sitting EVERYONE). 

Could he get injured and it not work out? Yes. Is it still worth a shot. Yes. Definitely yes at that cost.  Ingram could turn into our primary scorer, and closing scorer, which this team desperately needs. Not to mention I think his 3% will rise, as he will be getting fed more and have to rely less on pull-up 3's.

If we have IQ shooting and passing, RJ going downhill/rim pressure/corner 3, BI shooting 3's and creating his own shot from the midrange, Scottie being able to facilitate, get midrange shots up, and crash the boards for putbacks, and Yak facilitating, push shots, and rebounding. I feel like that is a real possibility and would be amazing.

  
Quickley - fucking idiotic how people were throwing him under the bus and saying he was a bust or overpay. HE WAS INJURED or returning from injury, and wasnt able to get into a flow. He deserves to get a stretch of uninjured play to be assessed. Definitely had some games and stretches where you see him looking like an all-star. I can also see him playing more off ball and Scottie running a bit more point forward, and letting IQ shoot more. 

SG logjam. Would love to see RJ work with this team, but can also see where it doesnt gel and we are able to package him up with some filler or picks (maybe with Jak?) for a better positional fit (perfect world stretch 5) or young talent/picks. He still has 2 years left on a relatively cheap contract. Could also see us trading RJ, for a negative contract for a year or two for draft picks or young player. RJ could be a great upgrade for a contender who has an underperforming player at around 25 million dollar mark

Taking time to develop Gradey and Ja'Kobe will be very important and if Ochai can keep his 3% up he is a great 8th guy off the bench, occasional starter. 

We could even package up RJ, either Gradey or Ja'Kobe and Yak (and picks?) for something special. That still leaves us good enough depth to be successful.",1,15572.0,1746809911.0,torontoraptors

I think this summer will be a big one fr player movement especially if teams like the Celtics, Cavs, Nuggets bow out in round 2. Those teams are expensive and will need to make moves.

It was a small price to pay to obtain an All-Star level talent in his prime. The Pels can act like they fleeced us but we got a massive upgrade at a position of need for very cheap...Ingram is a 45+ million dollar player who we signed for substantially less because of his injury history and the fact that we were able to work out a deal before free agency. The alternative would have been to wait until free agency and then risk losing him to other teams who were willing to pay 40 plus million to him...they did that with FVV who's a tier below Ingram and look what happened...the Rockets threw 40 million at him and he signed with them.

mrcpehh,roostor222,"you can certainly do it by position if you want, but I don't think it's very meaningful when you can only pay two players that kind of money. There are 30 teams. 28 players played 30 minutes per game and had 28% usage or higher. Brandon Ingram ranked 23rd out of those 28 in true shooting this year. If your goal is to compete for a championship then that's never going to be good enough because almost every single night you're facing a better scorer.

He will have the #39 salary in the league next year and you're already paying Scottie Barnes more. You can't pay anyone else, so unless you get major scoring efficiency out of nowhere from a vet or a rookie, the offense has no shot be top 10, which is what you'll need to contend.

I understand your point about not wanting to take a step back and lose the salary while you're an over the cap team, but taking on a bad contract when you have no hope of real contention isn't good. Scottie Barnes and Immanuel Quickley aren't good enough. RJ Barrett stinks. Adding Brandon Ingram to that mix isn't going to put you over the top and you'd have been better off bottoming out than taking on Ingram.",0,438.0,1746756391.0,torontoraptors

He holds onto the ball forever, takes a long time to get to his spot dribbling the air out of the ball, takes a bad shot, and then does it all again the next time down the court. 

>You're also, again, missing the key part. The choice was not ""pay BI or pay another FA"". It was ""pay BI or keep the picks"". Try to address that if you respond to me again.

I don't see that as the fundamental decision, which is why I didn't address it as such. The pick is most likely going to be in the 20s, and will probably turn out to be of little consequence. The fundamental decision was whether to double down on mediocrity by adding Ingram to Quickley-Barrett-Barnes or to admit that core isn't winning anything and start moving pieces out the door. Absolutely no one else wanted to pay Ingram that money. No one wants any of the big contracts you have.

Big - **John Collins** \- 6'9"", average defender, 39.9% 3p shooter last season, career 36.3% (includes time playing through injured hand)

Big - **Taylor Hendricks** \- 6'9"", defensive monster, career 36.8% 3p shooter

Big - **Cooper Flagg** \- 6'9"", defensive monster, 38.5% 3p shooter last season (College)

and...

Small - whoever will get them the ball, either **Isaiah Collier** for the assist machine, or if we want a 5th shooter out there, **Collin Sexton** (last season 40.6% from 3, career 38.7%) or Keyonte George (last season 34.3% from 3, career 33.9%) ...

OR, if Cooper Flagg becomes comfortable enough to handle the ball and essentially run point, then another

Big - **Kyle Filipowsi** \- 6'11"", average defender (better perimeter defender than inside, which actually goes WELL with this combo), 35.0% 3p shooter last season.

The crazy thing? The best 3p shooter on the Jazz isn't even listed. We could also plug in **Brice Sensabaugh** \- 6'5"", poor defender, but 42.2% 3p shooter last season (career 39.2%).

The lineup, of ***Markkanen, Collins, Hendricks, Flagg, and Filipowski*** is almost legit, and it would be one of the tallest lineups ever, with a total height of 410 inches, WHILE ALSO having a lineup of 5 different good-to-great 3point shooters on the floor at the same time, with nobody under 6'9"". How do you even guard that?! (Sidebar, here's a fun article I found about tallest lineups ever - [https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/the-tallest-recorded-starting-lineups-in-nba-history](https://www.basketballnetwork.net/latest-news/the-tallest-recorded-starting-lineups-in-nba-history) \- and this lineup would be just a couple inches short of an NBA record. Sub in **Walker Kessler** \- 7'0"", monster defender, for any of the 3 different 6'9"" guys, and you're at 413 total inches, second tallest NBA lineup ever)

In terms of ""on paper"" or ""if I were to play a season as the Jazz in 2k25"" or whatever, having a starting 5 of Markkanen, Collins, Hendricks, Flagg, and Filipowski, would be so much fun. It would be so, so awesome to see that random daydream come to life. Wow, that ended up being a long post.

The 92-93 Jazz were a disappointment going 47-35 and lost in the first round.    
  
The Jazz would replace every member of the 1992-93 roster except for Stockton and Malone over the next 3 seasons before making the NBA finals in 1997.   
  
I have always thought this would make a great documentary - how the franchise literally rebuilt its entire roster around the 2 superstars in just 3 years to get themselves into the NBA finals.

mrfuuno,w000dsyOwl,"For the Greek Freak I’m making that deal in a heartbeat. I think the Bucks would actually want more and not accept this offer. 

Rim running centers without a 3 point game are easy to find in the draft. Ivey is a great story sure but hasn’t shown enough to be a long term investment. Tobias is in there to help match the salaries. Punting on Ron Holland this early in his career would be tough to swallow if he reaches stardom but there needs to be value for the Bucks to give up their franchise guy. 

Look at the trade between the Jazz and Cavs for Mitchell as a guideline for a trade like this. Cavs had a guy with Garland and just drafted Mobley. Traded for Mitchell to build around a core 3 of players. Also stole Jarrett Allen from the Nets for a 1st round pick that wasn’t theirs originally. Pistons could eventually be a #1 seed just like the Cavs this season if they were to add a star like Giannis to pair around Cade and Ausar plus role players. The next move would be for a rim protecting center. 

Here are the details of the Cavs/Jazz trade 

Cavaliers receive:
Donovan Mitchell

Jazz receive:
Collin Sexton
Lauri Markkanen
Ochai Agbaji
2025 first-round pick
2026 pick swap
2027 first-round pick
2028 pick swap
2029 first-round pick

I think there would be a bunch of pick swaps added to your originally package for Giannis like this trade.

Make the thick number slightly smaller, and the thin name slightly taller

That might be able to give you better spacing

I DO think that y'all squad plays worse than your talent. Brunson is a baller. A flopping MF but also undeniably a hooper. But Kat is soft as Charmin. As big as he is and as well as he shoots, he should have DESTROYED us every game the way he did with those clutch shots at the end of game 4. We didn't have anybody that could actually stop him.

Reasons for optimism

* Good to see JK play well, could use a punch of scoring off the bench if we want to steal a game. He did well to leak out early before Gobert gets sets [like he does here](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/384/630e7b79-8144-7c6a-ac7e-2251f10ebca5_1280x720.mp4). [Pushing off made buckets is huge too](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/333/e1663cf6-0676-626a-20d4-b879944f613f_1280x720.mp4).

* Might be a real chance for TJD to contribute. Similar to how Gafford/Lively found space behind Gobert for lobs last year, [TJD did much of the same](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/277/7af91fe0-f02f-3ba8-4c51-d1ae8283e515_1280x720.mp4). The 4-5 P&R [here was super cool too](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/491/311cdd0d-89c7-1696-0f22-b9712884fd4a_1280x720.mp4).

* Don't have clips, but thought Dray's been really on it on both ends of the court. The defense has been amazing this series, mucking up drives, quarterbacking the backline, timely switches. Offensively, I think he's found the right level of aggression (unlike the Houston series). The shots will hopefully fall, but this is the level of aggression we'll need from Dray if we need steal a game.

One big reason for pessimism

* The half-court creation remains a huge worry. [Jimmy can't get anything against Gobert](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/400/5f67f678-5a54-205c-1a2a-59f6abd0530d_1280x720.mp4), Buddy takes a grenade.

mrgcqnr,Otherwise-Fig9592,"Not a homer take.

I dont think this would be very entertaining if steph were healthy.

With Steph, this isn't close. Dubs probably win comfortably in 5. This wolves team is not even close to being on the same level as the rockets. It's all about matchups, and the wolves dont match up well as a team vs the dubs. They have so much that's wrong with their offense, starting with two non shooters in randle and gobert, and two dudes in ant and randle who are clearly at their best when they're allowed to go 1v1 iso ball, which by the way, has a tendency to ice out players because they're never involved and never in rhythm.  Against a smart team like the dubs, coached by kerr who is so good at attacking teams' weaknesses, this is a bad matchup for them. Defensively, they have 3 big dudes in mcdaniels, randle and gobert. Great for front line d, but vs smaller quicker warrior players, they cant keep up. Mcdaniels is great vs bigger slower players like reaves, luka, rui, and lebron, but vs steph, jimmy, buddy, podz, etc, he's good, just not great. They have size, but dubs are used to winning against teams with size. Nothing new to them. They outrebounded them in gm1 for instance. Got 6 more offensive boards than the wolves. Gobert as a rebounder is not close to steven adams, who was the rocket's offensive rebounding lifeline with all their misses.

Fans dismiss this readily (even dubs fans), but the team went 3-1 vs the wolves in the regular season for a reason. People are quick to point out that it was because randle was still being integrated. The truth is, it's just a bad matchup for them.

As to why it happens like that? I honestly think it's because kerr never has any plans to run the offense thru him. With kerr's offense, seems like everything has to be in sync and everyone has to have a role around the main ball handler, who is usually curry/dray/jimmy. So when things break down, and jk decides to take matters into his own hands, guys are probably like, ""wtf?"". They then end up just standing around not sure what to do maybe. Or maybe they're secretly annoyed that he's doing that. Probably explains why kerr benched jk at the end of the reg season?

that said, there's too many shook ones on the team right now. guys accustomed to PASSING instead of FINISHING/SHOOTING the damn ball. Moses Moody. GPII, etc. Podz going to the rim. if you're going to the rim, go to the rim WITH FORCE. no pausing, no passing out at the last second. ditto for the perimeter ""shooters"", guys get the ball with a brief moment of openness, pause looking to pass, and the moment is gone and the whole action is reset to zero - we then end up with bad desperation shots at the end of the 24-sec clock. that can't fly. btw now and Saturday all these guys need to put up AT LEAST 500 threes, get some kind of feel for shooting, and shooting it in one fluid motion regardless of if the defender is recovering to him

i don't think Minnesota so far looks as tough as Houston defensively, but right now we don't have enough offense to stay with them. i hope Kuminga/TJD get more PT, we're going to need both. right now Post/Moody might need to sit unless they're more effective. it's a small thing but i really didn't like seeing Steph on the bench, sitting/standing like that, i want that guy IMMOBILIZED lol with like Himalayan flower sap slathered on his hammy while like 2 room-sized machines are hooked up to it just rejuvenating it 24/7 like the damn DBZ meme lol. at least be in a wheelchair or SOMETHING Steph lol

1. Kuminga needs more minutes. He was probably the lone bright spot on offense. He looked good

2. Moody isn’t playable. Dude is a black hole on offense and defense. If a 3 and D guy isn’t doing either, he’s gotta stop getting minutes. 

3. Podz needs to focus on facilitating. His shot isn’t falling at all. Focus on getting lobs to TJD/Kuminga, and finding Buddy open looks. take some pressure off Butler as a ball handler. 

4. TJD opens up lobs on offense which can be big if we can keep playing Gobert off the floor. Downside is he was a sieve on defense for the most part. 

5. Draymond idk man keep it in check, you can’t be the leader of the team if you can’t stay on the floor because of your temper.

5. Pat Spencer ain’t it. Love the hype, but he was bad. Can’t shoot, couldn’t finish.

Moody has been trash since the playoffs except garbage minutes. Dude feels so lost. 

Podz has to wake up as well.

Spencer's minutes should be cut. Dude gets blown by everyone.

Draymond has to control his emotions. They arent blown up by 50 because of him. He has been their best player this series all bec of his defense. As long as he doesnt get ejected they are fine.

- TJD is effective against this lineup most esp when Gobert is off the floor.

in terms of the loss, it's fine that we lost, but I just think we could've had a better fight. why did we run a lineup with no Jimmy/Draymond in the 2nd against their 1st/2nd unit mix? we barely scored bc nobody knew what to do, and defense was non-existent. what's worse is that we brought the game back to within 7 only for kerr to take that lineup out and play the bench again. we had a chance to make a run and actually see if that lineup can win/hold up when the wolves gassed up again, why don't we play our guys? why don't we try to win (or even give up in the 4th if it doesn't work)? i get that experimenting is a thing, but experimenting with spencer? with santos? why bother experimenting players/lineups that we'd NEVER even would see in the playoffs if steph was healthy?",1,1476.0,1746767583.0,warriors

What i find interesting is that apparently his vertical is pretty dang good at 39 inches. Maybe it's jumping off one leg that he's weak at doing. There are times where he skies very high for a rebound off two feet

Late-season at Oracle (low-mid bowl) was *insanely* loud. Massively louder than Chase last weekend in the low-nosebleeds. 

Got a migraine at Oracle and couldn’t hear right for a day or so. My whole head felt like it was in a fishbowl. LOUD. 

Got none of that at Chase. Listened to a BBC podcast on the way home last weekend and could hear every word of the hosts mumbling quietly about British politics. That would have been impossible if that game had been played at Oracle, because my hearing would have been blown out.

At Oracle, the crowd was going when two conditions were met: (1) the game clock was going and (2) the Warriors had the ball. That was it. At Chase, people only cheered when someone scored. They didn’t cheer the actual offensive or defensive play, which I found odd. (Why the hell else would you go to the game?)

Only two Warriors games I’ve ever been to, though (and game 6 fell apart towards the end), so your experience might be different. Also - tickets weren’t cheap either time (~$500 all in, both times), but it felt like something special was going on so I wanted to see it.",-2,20570.0,1746807484.0,warriors

mrdqct0,beentheredonesome,"I love Draymond for everything he's done for the team to help us win championships, but let's get real about his behavior.

He gets upset when an opponent gets the better of him.  This could be on a single play like stripping him blocking him, or just outplaying him over the course of a game.  He can also get upset when the team is losing even if he is more or less playing ok.

What he does is he looks to get a free dirty shot on a player and acts like it was a natural motion.  The worst part is that Dubs fans, including myself at times, pretend along with Draymond that it was an accident or a normal basketball move.  That's bullshit, and we know it.  He will never own up to it and we as fans are kind of reluctant to admit it.  But it's obvious to a neutral observer and it's a big reason why other fan bases hate him so much.  

The spinning back elbow to Nurkic, kicking Adams in the nuts repeatedly, clocking FVV and now Nas Reid, and all the other ones in-between.  

He's got other problems as well.  I swear sometimes it's obvious he doesn't want to be in a game so he engineers two techs and gets to walk off.

mqgyp8l,Niceguydan8,"-Harden's scoring was terrible.  His facilitating was great and the Nuggets were selling out on Harden early on. He was making the right decision a lot of the time despite his horrific scoring.

-That portion early in the 2nd when Dunn subbed in for Harden for ~2-3 mins was a fucking *disaster.*

-I think Kawhi as a first option guy is pretty much done.  Not assertive enough in most of these games, including this one. He's been good overall in the series, and definitely efficient.  But I think his volume is too low offensively for a non-facilitating offensive star.

-The bad shooting role players were generally awful in this game and this series.  Norm is a good shooter, but he falls in here too.  He was atrocious most of the series and I think probably the largest contributor to actually losing the series with how much he underperformed.

Overall though, really fun season! Definitely exceeded expectations.

I mean, he started holding the ball early on and just dribbling until the double team came.  He took 8 fucking shots.  8.  He didn't even turn it over much! Why Lue put Kawhi on Gordon when we have Batum.  

We got beat by a team that has no bench while we were fully healthy.  

Zu gotta go.  This is the perfect time to trade him.  His numbers are up.  But these last two games show that we are not going to win with him as the starting center.  Sure, he can matchup with Jokic, but he couldn't even dunk on him when he had the chance.  He's too nice.

So, who is gone?  We know Ben is gone, and maybe Coffey.  Batum might retire after this, he probably won't have a better season next year.  Mills is gone.  Eubanks has no guaranteed money for next year according to what I read, so he might be gone.  Harden will opt-in, most likely, not like we can get an upgrade for him.

mqiby1b,Niceguydan8,"I'm re-watching the game and have a couple of things I guess I didn't realize the extent of while watching real-time:

-The Nuggets were trapping Harden *hard* the whole game, [here's an example of what I'm talking about](https://imgur.com/a/0nbVsjV).  There are possessions where he's getting doubled shortly after crossing halfcourt. Usually (not always) he's making the right play, but there's some hesitancy after the pass out of the double from the other guys that let's Denver recover.

-Good god that 2nd quarter lineup with Kawhi, Batum, Norm, Dunn, Bogi was so god damn bad, lol. [This is the Kris Dunn effect and how he makes offense harder for every other player when he's on the court](https://imgur.com/a/rKStqc2)

-This one probably can't be understated: The lead absolutely ballooned when they started giving Norm these possessions in the 3rd and he was genuinely abysmal.  The game got out of hand when Norm was just throwing the ball away for no reason and the Nuggets got hot on the other end.  Prior to that stretch, the team was losing but it was like low-double digits at most.

I still think Harden overall could have/should have done better, but I think in a lot of these possessions that I'm looking at, he's making the correct decision and usually doing so in a timely manner. 

I think Denver just challenged the non-Harden players to beat them and they weren't able to do it.

mrghj5x,Early_Specific1433,"i mean.. the first two games of their series has played out almost identical to ours and they actually stole home court now.

mrgt9q7,bucketGetter89,"Yup a bit of luck goes a long way in the playoffs. Same with Cavs and pacers. Cavs fans will be shocked to be down 2 where they easily could’ve been up 2. It’s not even a knock on their squad or that they aren’t good enough, sometimes you really just need the ball to bounce your way a couple more times",2,11855.0,1746817396.0,LAClippers
mrgozc3,arebeewhy,"Absolutely FOLDED. Harden in game 7 in particular, but his history of doing just that in the playoffs is well documented. It’s also due largely to his system which relies heavily on his ability to be a fairly efficient high volume scoring threat. Kobe said it best when analyzing Harden and why he won’t win in the playoffs unless he adapts to a different play style. 

Also OKC lost their home court advantage. Series is tied 1-1. Why exaggerate what is happening there? 

I just can’t get behind coulda, woulda, shoulda takes to push a narrative that a veteran heavy team is on the brink. It could just as easily be used to prove that a team gave it everything and still wasn’t able to get over the hump. 

Here are the facts. Nobody outside of maybe Westbrook is driven to cement their legacy by winning in the Playoffs more than Harden. Nobody outside of maybe Steph is as feared of a performer in the playoffs when the game is on the line as Kawhi. Neither of those guys were able to push this roster enough to get out of the first round. 

Those reasons make it tough to view simply running it back as anything but a failure. It’s OK, 90+% of the league fails to some degree in a given year. Most of them spend resources improving either their immediate roster or upgrading future resources in the off season.  
Unfortunately unless the Clippers make some trades, they aren’t really in position to do either thing.",1,5287.0,1746816085.0,LAClippers

Let’s be real, this wasn’t unexpected, we know what’s wrong with this team and we know the playoffs highlight that.

They’ve fought hard and put up a pretty damn decent effort all 4 games, and I’m happy they could get that game 3 win. 

Doesn’t matter if you hate Boston or not they’re the defending champs, and as much as everyone here doesn’t wanna admit it, they have a pretty damn good team. But over the last couple years we’ve seen that we have 2 VERY YOUNG stars who are already capable of carrying us for a game here or there if called upon to do so. Yes they sometimes have bad games, but they’re being asked to put the entire team on their backs every… single… fucking… night. It’s not sustainable to ask them to carry that kind of load night in and night out. And if you can get off your goddamn ass and build an offensively-competent roster around that, you can win a LOT of games. They’re so young and still years away from their prime and if you can take some of the pressure off of them, maybe they can start to blossom to their full potential. You also have two solid pieces in Suggs and Mo that aren’t even contributing right now. It’s a good base to start from, but they absolutely *must* begin to make significant moves to start down that path.

mphy6e2,FamousAtticus,"Franz played an ok game last night but seating a few rows up from the court last night I couldn't help but notice how he burned the team a couple of times by staying on one end of the court to complain about a non call (which he was right about) when Jaylen held his arm on a drive, which happened a couple of times. With Franz staying back complaining & getting pissy it left us down a man on D which allowed Boston to capitalize on offense. Franz needs to work on keeping his cool, dudes body language didn't hide the fact he was crazy frustrated for the majority of last night, I get it, but Boston smelt that blood in the water.

Gary (surprise) and Caleb were brutal last night. KCP finally decided to hit a couple of 3's. Coach Mos' lineups boggle my mind sometimes. He leaves cold players in too long or doesn't adequately call a TO when the Magic lose momentum or Boston goes on a run. Crazy annoying at times.

Overall, I wasn't expecting a Magic upset this series. The Celtics are the defending champs and they play like it. In order to steal another game we play a near flawless game, disrupt on D, make open shots and HIT OUR FUCKIN' FREE THROWS. The refs ensure we don't make it to the line at anywhere near the same frequency as Boston, so we have to do better than shoot 70% from the line. Those 6 misses are unacceptable. 

Hope game 5 is at least competitive and we can find a way to bring it back home for at least one more game at TD Garden south.

mpfiwzz,dlbags,"It’s simple. In crunch time they made their shots and we didn’t. Our stars were gassed because Mose over played them and generally anyone not names Franz or Paolo doesn’t take the impetus to take shots or push the ball except in tiny sample sizes. Players like AB need to get the ball and stop deferring to the stars even when they miss. I feel when players not the big two and miss they don’t want to take more shots. So as annoying as Caleb was missing those shots at least he had the guts to take them.  

Ultimately this is still a very young team and we are missing two major players. Suggs is a huge miss KCP has been an unmitigated disaster Harris useless and WCJ too inconsistent. 

Some issues like I mentioned including shooting hopefully will improve with some players as they get experience and others with personnel changes. This team currently ain’t it. But pretending this year wasn’t massively derailed by injuries is kinda dumb too. More than one thing can be true and we lost a lot of time this team needed to grow and gel together by the stop start nature of all the injuries. 

Hopefully we can take another game or two but honestly it’s moot because if you aren’t in it to win it you’re just selling playoff tshirts. This team has zero chance at winning it all. 

All that said Suggs, Paolo, Franz, and imo AB all look like a solid group to grow into even better players. Hopefully we make moves and maybe draft a gem or two in this packed draft class. Either way this season was a bit of disappointment regardless of whatever narrative you chose to buy into. I’m saving my long term thoughts on Mose and Weltman until after this draft and summer moves. I do feel there’s potential in this core we can build off tho. All hope isn’t lost.

I don’t understand why they extended Wendell. There’s probably some untapped upside but I doubt he realizes it playing with Paolo and Franz. When Mo was healthy they seemed to have serviceable centers along with Goga. 

I would have thought they try to use his salary and maybe a Jett or Houstan and picks for a starting PG. 

Maybe they are just waiting around for AB to blow, but the coach certainly isn’t treating the situation that way.  Cole helps tremendously with Mo out to give them bench scoring but depending on how things shake out you probably don’t need both of those guys in the rotation. 

A Suggs-AB backcourt with Paolo-Franz playing half of the 5-4 minutes next to a better shooting wing than KCP apparently and a serviceable center to allow them to go 4-3 like they do now is probably a more realistic outcome than trading for a star PG because I just don’t see anyone out there that makes sense.

You can argue they had to do too much, as opposed to Tatum/Brown, and I think that is accurate. Celtics have a decisive advantage in their #s 3-8 rotation guys. The Celtics 6th best player would easily be the Magic’s #3 in this series.

I think coming into the series, it was clear the best the Magic could likely do was play the Celtics tough and steal a game. The next most likely outcome wasn’t the Magic stealing two games, but the Magic getting swept.

You guys match up really well with us. You can tell how much the defense gives our guys trouble, especially if you take away the perimeter shooting and disrupt the passing lanes.  

One of the most glaring problems I saw with the Magic, which is true for any team, especially in the playoffs is that you can't have 2 guys trying to do it all offensively. Banchero and Franz are obvious studs but I'm impressed with the supporting cast, at least defensively.  I haven't watched that many Magic games this year, maybe ~15 ish, but idk what happened to KCP and why's he's taken this downward turn.  

I honestly don't think the Celtics squad was ready for the physicality coming into the series and I think it's a good thing for them to face, should we advance from the first round, I think it will force them to be tougher. The games have been frustrating as hell but also some fun basketball to watch.

Myles Turner is the #1 option. He does everything WCJ does but better. Might be pricey, but I'd rather pay him 30 mil this season than KCP and Harris another 30 mil combined. 

A little undersized but a much better shooter, Naz Reid could become a free agent this summer if he chooses to. 

Brook Lopez is expected to hit FA this season. Not a long term solution, but I think would be a good starting option, with a strong center rotation behind him that we currently have.

I wish we had put more money towards Hartenstein last summer instead of KCP but that's old news. 

Anyway, those are the options I see realistically for this coming FA. There's also always the option to trade for one, but Im not sure if you were genuinely asking, or wanting to make a point?

WCJ had poor OFFENSIVE advanced stats last year. 54 % TS for a big is rough. Think Goga finished with 63 TS in comparison. Because he is simply smarter. 

He is trying to space the floor, but no one guards him anyway. Tho in reality he provides the same spacing as Goga. But Goga actually cleaning up misses better and getting better positioning on offense. And finishes with a better TS %.

centers have to be at least good at 1 thing on offense

- offensive rebounding (you get your offense more shots -> likely higher ORtg)
- rim rolling for lobs (gravity)
- space the floor (shooting)
- or have such good post moves that you can score in the post on your own

you could make the argument WCJ did nothing of those things really well on a consistent basis.

Its to the point, where you might look at the draft, and get someone like Sorber, if you think he can be a future starter in this league.

Look on the sportsbooks.  Boston is still favored to win the series -125. If you believe in NY that much you can get an even money bet that they can win 2 out of the next 5 games.

Edit - it’s also interesting NY’s odds get longer as the series goes on.  I take that as the books think Boston either goes full collapse or Boston wins the series.

mrascqw,red2play,"The league has changed.  Trae is going to have to be able to hold his opponents down for a split second on defense to make any real runs into the playoffs.  They targeted Max Straus when they had Okoro on the bench.  We need more playmakers and so I hope we take Egor Demin, if he's there.  He's a SF/PG that can compliment Trae and take over if he's on the bench and he can play defense.  He gives an extra wing and a defender and a playmaker at 6'9"".

I don't agree with trading for a star, I think that we should continue to construct a team around Trae and if we prove that we can win, we can get stars without giving up the farm.  Fox to the Spurs, Jimmy Butler to GSW, 70% of the players on the Celtics, all prove that if a star wants to play with you, you can have the stars on the cheap.  

Forcing a trade, trying to get stars with picks and players always leaves you gimped while other teams can easily pick up stars.  Just start winning and they will come and be patient.

If Trae decides to leave next year, which I doubt will happen, we just need to continue to improve the roster just like OKC, Rockets, Magic, etc.

Before anyone brings up the Nuggets, they would have easily had a star but they vastly overpaid MPJ.  They in the tax even before any FA would come there and they let KPJ and Bruce Brown Jr because of said contract.

This notion that Trae doesn't have any help is bullshit. For the past three years and I am being generous Trae has been the common denominator but the Hawks fanbase would rather be mediocre than to take a chance on the Hawks going in a different direction organization-wise by resetting the configuration of the FO and by extension the roster.

Celtics: Derrick White and Jrue Holiday. White is strong defensively and can shoot 3s, Jrue is basically an older and more experienced Dyson.

Cavs: Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland. Two all-stars. 

Knicks: Brunson and Mikal Bridges. Bridges is the 3-and-D guy they just mortgaged their future for.

What would the trade package look like?  There is an opportunity cost as he wouldn't be free.  The Hawks would improve the most by giving up as little NBA talent as possible and giving up draft picks instead but then the Hawks would have difficulties improving in the future.

Dyson just had a good year.  Let's say the Hawks trade him plus 2 or 3 FRP.  You essentially have Jaylen Brown instead of Murray.  Maybe the team is improved but you are still asking for a lot of progression from JJ and Risacher and then you have little draft capital to work with.

mraepa8,PeasePorridge9dOld,"Yeah, you can. Without researching, I’d bet that >> 80% of FA signings are either SnT or through an Exception. Unless you have Max level $$, cap space is generally worthless - even teams below the floor will sometimes act as an above the cap team if they aren’t chasing the top end of the market. Thing about SnTs is that you are generally trading for the cap space over the player and there are well worn prices for cap space. We have the additional advantage of not actually needing the other team to eat $$ to create the space which should drive down the cost.

I don’t care about the $$ for picks at 13 & 22. Those picks should be trade fodder if the right player is available. Auburn’s starting lineup was older than ours. We have enough youth. It’s time to get some adults in the room.

The combine is next week so that’s when the rumors should start leaking about what teams could be doing this offseason. Some of the rumors I’ll be tracking
- teams that are looking at tax / apron thresholds. Obviously these are the teams that will be most interested in jettisoning salary and would place the highest value on not taking players back. IND (Nembhard, Toppin, & Neismith), ORL (Anthony, KCP), CLE (Jerome, Hunter - lol), MIN (Reid, NAW). All of them will be traversing new territory and might be a bit cautious.
- Teams that are looking at massive philosophical shifts, typically those transitioning to new leadership. SAC (Malik Monk)is the one that I’m looking at directly but other trans such as DEN, PHI, NOP, MIL, CHAR, LAL, and PHX could try to pull off something massive that could involve several teams each with a small part. Those are always fun.
- Last is the FA market and SnTs. These are trickier since we can’t include our picks this year in a package for them without getting investigated. Looking if teams are having productive conversations with their FAs or are we seeing some with roving eyes. Specifically have eyes on Santi Aldama and Naz Reid. Will also track Kuminga. Other could come up here too.",1,16687.0,1746728953.0,AtlantaHawks

mrb6h95,TerrorizingThunder,"A team can use their trade exception to acquire a FA via sign & trade yes. However they can’t sign a FA outright with money from a trade exception is what I’m saying. Monk would be a nice addition, but it would probably take #22 to acquire him. Also with LeVert likely to resign & ya’ll sending picks for Mann it’s probably better to keep #22, sign Tyus, & land  Toppin for three 2nds because he provides needed front court depth with Capela likely leaving. 

Aldama & Reid will resign with their respective teams in my opinion. No need for Kuminga when Johnson, who is better, is already there. That would just end up being a bad contract. I believe this plan of mine here is a realistic offseason plan.",2,250.0,1746737157.0,AtlantaHawks

mrbwuz0,PeasePorridge9dOld,"... and what I'm saying is that maybe 4-5 players out of dozens or even 100's of FAs are signed with pure cap space in an off-season so why does it matter. It doesn't have much impact on signing an FA so why even continue to bring it up? 

I'd do Monk for 22. You're wildly overrating 22, especially in this draft. Already said the roster is too youth heavy so having less picks would be a good thing in my book. If they kicked in Ellis, then I'd hand over 13 instead - assuming we can navigate the contract.

Iffy on Toppin. I wouldn't mind acquiring him but idk if I'd burn the burn entire DJ TPE on just him. If he came with Nesmith then I'm sure something could be worked out. Would prefer to not hand over multiple 2nds in future years; Landry left the cupboard bare there and we need to restock. Would consider dropping from 13 to 23 for the right package.  
  
I'm fine on Tyus, but he feels more like a final piece than a centerpiece of the off-season. idk if he can play alongside Trae ala someone like Monk. Monk has proven off ball ability, but Tyus has always been ball in hand. Think we could get more defensively out of Monk too (albeit a very low bar). 

I suspect Reid and Aldama will be returning as well but both of their teams are about to have to make some hard decisions in regards to salary. Would be worth it to force both teams to take out the checkbook and at least match on $25M. No agent worth his salt would let the team just deny the SnT for no one and still play hard ball.

Kuminga is basically the worst centerpiece I could see us getting and still thinking we had even a semi-successful off-season. Neither F position has a backup so there's plenty of minutes for the taking. The fact that we've got no creator after Trae means that we have a lot of opportunity to sell. Would he come in on a 2 + 1 if he can compete for the keys to the O for 10-15 minutes/night? I'm sure that answer would depend on the other bidders too...",1,16687.0,1746745876.0,AtlantaHawks

Gil is a dumbass, but I don't actually think he pushes peoples buttons for any real malicious reason other than him trying to keep things light and enjoyable. He seems to regret the gun locker room incident, but also interesting to learn he kept a collection and was constantly buying on the road during his playing days for his collection.

One thing I thought that was by far the stupidest part of Javaris' story; dude said he wanted to be home, around his people; friends and family etc - understandable, especially after things not working out in the NBA, cool. He understood his town in Georgia was not a good place and the projects were dangerous. Why the fuck are you walking around iced out, in nice clothes with a nice car, and staying strapped?

Like bro you know what the streets are. You wanna be there for the support, you know showing off in an area like that is gonna draw attention. I'll give you a pass on the first robbery, but the second robbery? You didn't make any adjustments to your lifestyle aside from staying strapped?

You get robbed again, not once, but twice?! The cops tried to help but you didn't want to snitch and escalate things yourself with 'street justice'?

Fucking idiot bro. Should never have been in that dumbass situation if you just stopped showing off. Don't need to be strapped if you got nothing to get robbed over.

mrdj493,kingjawn,"Def worth a watch.

Couple thoughts…

A lot of people make comments that Gilbert came off as a bigger asshole than the actual murderer but i fall on the other side. Crittenton seems like the guy with an excuse for everything. Something about the workout story where he got accused of stealing sandals really stuck out to me. I get that whatever happened probably got overblown but after everything with the gun charge why are you even putting yourself in that position at a workout where you’re trying to salvage your career? 

Also, the movie leads you to believe that the locker room gun incident led Crit down the wrong path and if it hadn’t happened all of the tragic events years later may have been avoided. Maybe. But Crittenton was an active member of the crips as an NBA player. He also got a drug charge while out on bond and never seemed to leave the hood behind. I have a hard time thinking he wasn’t always bound to do something really fucked up.

Finally…i get you had to have Arenas as the movie’s headliner in order to market it but this was really a doc about Crit’s life. There’s like a 15-minute period in the movie where we don’t see or hear from Arenas at all. The most poingant moments were the words of Crit & Julian Jones’ mother. 

Also, being that Arenas & Crittenton have seemingly patched things up it was surprising there were no current day scenes of the two together or even a joint interview.",0,45236.0,1746769831.0,washingtonwizards

But OKC is smart enough to know there’s really nothing you can do to stop jokic’s offense. He’s going to impact the game on that end regardless. Focusing all your time on trying to stop his offense is kinda pointless. So OKC just said “alright, we’re going to make him unplayable on the other end.” 

Jokic guarding a big? Screen him onto a guard. Wide open shot. Jokic guarding a guard? Screen guard to guard, and again a wide open shot. Denver goes zone? Screen the action into jokic’s area and force him to close out on a guard. Again a wide open shot. Jokic plays the elbow? Just pull the big out and run cuts. Again wide open layups. All game long OKC attacked Jokic into oblivion and it resulted in like a 70% shooting, largely uncontested easy offensive half of basketball for them. I really can’t think of a single way Denver can possibly overcome this, because they *have* to play Jokic. They can’t just bench him, that’s silly.

Denver’s prayer going forward is either extremely hot shooting on the offensive end, or extremely cold shooting on wide open 3s by OKC on the other end. Hard to see that happening 3 times in the next 5 games. If OKC shoots horrible, they lose. If they shoot okay, they win. If they shoot well, they win easily.

mrex8wo,pufffsullivan,"Think about this for real for a second because adding their accolades later in their career is useless.

That team was not a good 3pt shooting team, their spacing was quite poor. Perkins would be useless against ihart and Chet, any pick and roll action involving him would be an auto bucket.

Harden was an awful defender. The heat hunted him relentlessly and he would be abused by the shai, JDub, Wiggins, Caruso, and Wallace. He would also struggle so hard offensively against pretty much all of the current wing players.

The way the current team defends pick and roll would be difficult for Ibaka and Collison. Neither were great ball handlers and a 17ft jump shot isn’t too helpful when the opposition has multiple 38+% 3pt shooters.

The game is way different now that it was 13 years ago. I love that team quite a bit but the defensive depth, 3 pt shooting, and versatile bigs would beat that 2012 team in a 7 game series.

2012 Ibaka was a force on defense but offensively was pretty streaky. Was always frustrating watching him— if he couldn’t win in the paint, he’d take some goofy shots from distance that were never good shots. 

Overall, the game has changed a lot since 2012 and we should be focusing on who the 2012 players were *at that time* and not who they became.

There’s levels to it, even amongst hyper competitive pro athletes, the degree to which players go hard in the offseason and improve in practices and lifestyle wise after being with a truly great player, it’s far beyond what a guy does while on the court, for an MVP or generational or GOAT candidate your off court impact needs to be scrutinized.

Still, I think Zion running point actually wears LESS on his body because he's facilitating instead of just trying to score all the time; he's getting more cardio and beating himself up less in the paint. But the THREAT of him in the paint remains.

Gayle Benson doesn't care about winning. She has no passion for sports. The Saints consistently receive failing grades from players...based on facilities and perks. It comes out every year on the NFL report card.

I don’t think injuries are a good excuse for this franchise. There are a few examples, but looking at Zion under SVG and under different coaches is frustrating. We had a system that worked, and then got rid of it. It’s kind of the meta for the management.

This management wants to constantly tweak things, but gets rid of any cohesiveness the team has to offer, and they’ve been doing it since letting go Monty Williams. It’s always a move to get rid of one young player to nab a “more established” older player, leading to a heavy top end without a supporting cast, a la Phoenix this year.

I think the biggest thing we need to figure out is when we draft a high end player or trade for a young high end player is keeping them healthy and helping them mature and become a true professional on and off the court.  A lot of this is also on the player to take their careers seriously from day one.

They really shut the window when they let him leave.  He also made up for Rasheed’s biggest weakness which was rebounding.  They should have seen it as a max contract for an extra 2 seasons of Ben.  The rest of that you just ride out as the cost of business or use to trade match.

mqq4c8a,the_cream_dreamer,Nice write up. I'm so skeptical with this team right now. Willie Green is a lame duck head coach. Dumars hasn't built a roster in over a decade.

Honestly, and this is obviously the conspiracy theorist side of me speaking, what are the chances that Adam Silver wants to push a Zion trade to a large market and in return we get Flagg? Almost a replica of AD and Zion in 2019. Kidding, of course, but imagine.

Teams like the Pels don't get saved by outside superstars, the only way we can really compete is by being smarter than other teams, drafting and developing talent, and using our assets to get the final piece of the puzzle. OKC is doing this right now (last night's game notwithstanding). Milwaukee developed Giannis and Khris and then traded for Jrue to put them over the top. Denver developed Jokic and Murray and traded for Gordon as the perfect complement. Sometimes the order can change a bit, like Cleveland trading for Donovan Mitchell, but that was a huge risk and it's only working out because they drafted and developed Garland and Mobley and managed to get Jarrett Allen on the cheap from Brooklyn. These are all smart moves that leverage the opportunities they had and striking at the right time. Trading for a bunch of superstars is what teams like Boston, Brooklyn, LA, Miami, and Phoenix do, places that the players already want to go.

The most frustrating thing is that the Pels have had more opportunities to do this than basically any other team.

They simply cannot take care of the ball. There’s zero chemistry between these 4 when the monk/sabonis pnr gets taken away. Endless DHOs that lead to nothing, demar or Zach have to launch a wild shot at the end of the shot clock, and that’s only when they manage to hold onto the ball.

Those 4 are probably among the worst defenders in the league too. Not just physically deficient at their positions, but bottom-tier IQs from all of them defensively.

This big 4 has gotta be the worst +/- starting lineup in the league. Like worse than most of New Orleans lineups.

Most of the competitive teams have the personnel to nullify his rebounding impact as well. Just being a screener & dho hub aint worth anything close to 40m lets keep it real.

He had plenty of time to improve on his shortcomings to become a more complete offensive player here but its yet to happen, atp I wouldnt be opposed to trading him at all.

Also no idea how some people seriously believe Keegan has potential to be a franchise player, he consistently has trouble handling the ball, even against weak defenders on single coverage. His potential is an elite 3&D (which is still nice to have but def not a top 3 player in a contending team) given what we seen in his first 3 seasons, and its been a while since his 3 ball was reliable as well. Hopefully he gets it back at some point, cuz he is just a rotational player if he doesnt",27,1754.0,1744868167.0,kings

Basically what Minnesota was running the last 2 seasons with Gobert and KAT.

But there are only 5 teams that had four starters shooting over .350 from 3pt range and taking 4 or more three pointers a game.  Between the Knicks, Bulls, Raptors, Pistons, and Spurs.  Of those five teams, only two of them made the playoffs. 

Among the top 4 seeds in both conference, Cleveland, Boston, OKC, and Houston; all four of them had three starters shooting over .350 from 3pt range and taking 4 or more a game.

16 teams had 3 starters that took more than 4 three pointers a game while shooting over .350.  Three teams had two.  Five teams had one.  The Magic didn't have one starter that shot over .350 from three while taking over 4 per game.

The entire argument that you need to have a 4 or a 5 that shoots three pointers proficiently to compete in today's 'floor spacing game' just doesn't hold up when you take a closer look at the stats.

For Sabonis to take 2 three pointers a game and shoot over .400 is good for his size.  It's his defense at either the 4 or the 5 that makes it tough to build a starting lineup with him in it.",2,8002.0,1746744047.0,kings

Putting him at the 4 would be an absolute disaster. He'd be eaten alive, and that doesn't even address the fact that his 3PT shooting comes only when he's uncontested. It would be a monumental task (I'd argue impossible) to not only get him shooting 3s with a close-out or hand in his face, but shooting them at a good percentage.

Keon/LaVine/Murray/Flagg/Sabonis is a good lineup. Carter, Monk, JV, and maybe LaRavia if they can keep him is a solid bench. + whatever trading DeRozan gets you.

They wouldn't be a top 4 seed but that starting lineup has very few holes - basically just missing an elite iso scorer (though LaVine sometimes is, when he feels like it) and a ""rim protector."" But I think the latter is overrated; the defense would still be really good between Ellis/Murray/Flagg and the rebounding would still be elite.

mrcju98,vNocturnus,"Flagg is a primary ball handler, Domas is also a high level offensive hub. In this theoretical scenario Keon is at most the tertiary ball handler, possibly even less than that with LaVine also being able to create offense a bit.

Plus, he just started running point with any kind of frequency more than halfway into last season. He looked better as he got more comfortable in the role and I think he has tons of potential to continue improving in that aspect of his game. He shouldn't be the plan A at the PG position unless they bring in a legitimate point forward like Flagg (and there's probably none on the trade market, so that's a really unlikely scenario), but if they do pull that off I think he's a *fantastic* option at the ""PG"" position given his shooting and defense.",1,53827.0,1746754317.0,kings

Maybe getting Flagg would change his mind, imo in that scenario it would make it a lot more palatable to do a proper blow up which would likely cost assets to pull off (to move off of LaVine, certainly, and possibly also DeRozan).

But again, in this magical christmas land, Flagg is a primary ball handler. I don't think it makes sense to get rid of the best scorer on the team for another ball handler when you just got a ball handler (Flagg) and presumably lost a scorer (DeRozan).

KD is 37, his advanced stats have been declining for several years, every since his masterful 2021 season where he was potentially a half-inch of his shoe away from carrying a depleted Nets team past the Bucks, his teams have underperformed.  While Beal has taken a lot of heat for his drop off since coming over from the Wizards, the Suns should really have made the playoffs if Durant was still a true star player.

So I'd be a bit more hesitant in how much I gave up for him, how much I relied on him, and I'd be curious if KD is willing to play the role necessary to win at this stage of his career or if he's locked into a need to be superstar.

Basically, a lot more questions marks and risk, unless you are really a team like the Mavs last season who maybe believed that if you added Durant to Luka and Irving it could have put you over the Celtics.",1,360327.0,1746820423.0,kings

A terrible roster that is overseen by a guy with next to no coaching experience is not a recipe for the playoffs. It would be one thing if they were looking to lose as many games as possible. However, we know that's not the case. Which means we're most likely look at a 7-12 lottery seed for the foreseeable future.

Some thoughts on it so far -

* Joel clearly only wants to be an MVP caliber player or not play. Feast or famine, I guess. No role player, back seat Joel.
* Certainly seems like we're going to sign Grimes. Daryl seems quite confident in the Maxey / Grimes back court. 
* Maxey / McCain backcourt seems less on the menu than anticipated. That part of the interview also brought into question his confidence in Joel's health, since he talked about how it's hard to run that backcourt, and is unlikely, but it would be possible with Embiid.

The Clippers are also just built better to function without Kawhi, and I think a lot of that has to do with how their salary is spread out across more (and generally better) players. I think what last year showed me (I basically stopped watching this team entirely when the they started actively tanking)is that *current* Maxey and PG just doesn't get the floor where it needs to be. I'm not saying they cannot get there this coming season. But last season they were clearly just not good enough individually.

Contrast that with the Clippers, where Harden + Norm + Zu was clearly a good enough core(that also fit and play really well with one another) where the floor was still reasonably high while Kawhi was recovering.

Maxey + PG make ~84m combined. 

Harden + Norm + Zu make ~66m combined. 

The difference between those two numbers(~18m) is very close to the salary amounts of DJJ, Batum, and Kris Dunn *combined.* Those are all fairly high quality role players that can consistently contribute to success in the regular season.

I really do think Embiid + PG + Maxey all on maxes (Maxey's being less because of his tenure) will be really hard to make work for a ""Kawhi"" recovery because the team is so top heavy compared to the Clippers, who really aren't.",10,483301.0,1746806072.0,sixers

I'll give Colangelo credit for the Fultz pick, that was a presumed BPA and a need fit, it just tragically didn't work out but that was a lot better than going 'random BPA'

Like, who cares if Noel is 'BPA' when he's a 6'11 pogo stick.  In the NBA, that just wasn't gonna translate. I'm not even talking hindsight, scouts need to do much better at Xing out certain prospects.

If you look at the way fans/'experts' talk, the only ones x'd out are guards(because how dare they be atypical size, when we've got these big wings/bigs, who shouldn't be guarded by guards anyway lol)

Indiana shot 1685 free throws this season to their opponents 2130. That is a substantial discrepancy that also kills the argument. Indiana is one of the few teams the consistently shoots less free throws than their opponent at home. This isn’t just a 2024-25 thing…it’s been like this for years.

I’m not sure I can fully explain why I liked his presser more, but he came across as more personable and relatable. He did a great job of acknowledging his success with the Nuggets without relying too heavily on it to claim he knows how to win. Instead, he seemed to understand that this is a new opportunity to build something unique using his experience, rather than forcing the team to fit his own established vision.

That was something I felt was a problem with Bud and Ishbia. Both seemed more focused on implementing their own idea of what winning should look like, rather than evaluating the roster and figuring out how to maximize the talent already there.

mqy9lcw,MaxPrints,"That article, if it's all true, sounds damning. Basically, Ishbia is promoting his guy, and the narrative was there that he was a big part of Dunn and Oso being drafted may just be fluff to support the promotion. 

And the people who **were** instrumental in making the call? Gone:

>  
""Internally, sources suggest Gregory’s fingerprints were all over the draft process, a sentiment reinforced by public framing following his promotion.  
""Sources confirm that Madkins, Fliposki, and their personnel team — including David Sevush (manager of player personnel evaluation), and scouts Charles Payne and Darrel Johnson — were central in pushing for the selections of Dunn and Ighodaro, valuing their defensive upside and cultural fit within a roster built around Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal.

>""But that narrative, while convenient, may be oversimplified — and misleading.

>""Multiple league sources and reports indicate that the final calls on Dunn and Ighodaro weren’t made by Gregory, but rather by assistant GM Gerald Madkins and front office executive Kyle Fliposki. Madkins, who joined the Suns in 2023 after holding a similar assistant GM role with the New York Knicks from 2017–20, brought nearly two decades of personnel and scouting experience to the table. His resume includes stops in Houston, New Orleans, and the Clippers, where his ability to identify under-the-radar talent was widely respected.

>""However, despite their contributions, Madkins, Sevush, Payne, and Johnson are all reportedly out of the organization. While their departures haven’t been officially announced, sources familiar with the Suns’ internal discussions confirm that the exits are not coincidental — they reflect a broader organizational reshuffling that’s left many inside the franchise stunned.

>""There’s a belief that no one knows who’s in charge, one high-ranking league source said. 

>“'This is a horror movie,' they shared.""  


The last two bits are more opinion, but I'm leaving it because of the multiple open quotations across all paragraphs.

To be fair, we don't know what Gregory is capable of, and he could end up being a diamond in the rough. What bothers me is that it seems the hiring process is obviously skewed towards having a relationship with Ishbia and a history with MSU more than actual experience or credentials.

They aren’t necessarily telling their direct reports how to do it, how long it should take. And obviously they’re involved in back and forth conversations where both sides are able to give input. But the person at the top of the org is always going to dictate the direction/vision, and the rung below needs to be capable of getting that done.

Great defender and key member of 7SoL Shawn Marion  shot just 18.2% from 3 in his rookie season across 51 games.  He also averaged 6.5 rebounds, 0.7 steals, 10.2 points in 24.7 minutes.  In his second year Marion got that 3 point shot up, but only to 25.6%.  He'd finish his career a 33.1% shooter from 3.

Ryan Dunn finished his rookie season 31.1% from 3.

My point?  Not only can a player develop a 3 point shot after entering the NBA, but you don't have to be elite from 3 to be an elite defender who earns there minutes and impacts games.",3,30648.0,1746807150.0,suns

The fact that Beal and Bridges were comparable in your cherrypicked numbers on offense isn't an argument in Beal's favor. Beal is a much worse defender and misses a ton of time. It only gets worse for Beal if you factor in the context of how each team uses them. Beal had the easiest job in the world: Be the third option with Booker and Durant. There were zero teams who were scheming against Beal, and he still was nowhere near an elite scorer. Even when he was playing against the opposing benches for over a month. Meanwhile, Bridges was in a Marion-type role with an offense that was not at all interested in prioritizing opportunities for him. He's comparably efficient to Beal while playing far, far more minutes and having actual defensive responsibilities. Look up some impact metrics. Beal's bad.

Putting aside my own personal feelings, this kind of shit is exactly what the Adelsons and Nico want. They're desperate for the fans to smile and cheer, and they're thrilled to have people like OP and others who constantly show up in this sub to tell people to shut up to become louder and more prevalent, so that we turn against each other. They want people like OP to turn on their fellow fans because they're not behaving the way they want.

""Toxic"" means destructive from within. I'd argue the only toxic ones involved in the Dallas Mavericks are the people running the team. The fans are some of the best in the league and are doing the best with what we have, while we watch an exact copy of last year's playoffs save for one team: the Mavericks. If that doesn't hurt, if that doesn't piss you off, and if that's not enough to make you ignore the ""toxic"" fans in the sub, goodbye my friend. I wish you well.",10,3759.0,1746812118.0,Mavericks

Yes it is. Luka's departure left a HUGE playmaking hole on this team. And Kyrie's isn't good enough to shoulder the entire playmaking burden on his own. Case in point, in the final game of the season, PJ and Lively, in a win-or-go-home situation, dropped 0 points. That would've NEVER happened under Luka's watch. Because not only is Luka a top-5 scorer in the league, he's also a top-3 playmaker. He not only elevates himself, he elevates the players around him. Something AD has never been capable of. And the ""defense wins championships"" narrative Nico kept going on and on about like a Pokemon is way overblown. Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense. Like against Memphis, we gave up 120 points. More than ANY playoff game last season, even the juggernaut Celtics, who had the #1 overall offense at the time. We in fact held those guys to 13 less ppg than their average. Defense was NOT the problem in the finals, it was our lack of offense and shooting, and we FIXED those issues in the off-season. Only for Nico to blow everything up for literally no reason. But anyways, back to the ""Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense"" point, you saw it against Memphis. On every other play, AD would fall to the floor thus causing him to run back late on defense and not be nearly as effective as he should be.",12,386843.0,1746722321.0,Mavericks

Sure him fouling out to go down 0-3 was really rough but maybe if the entire team didn’t shoot like single digit percentages from 3 the first two games they’re not even in a position to go down 3 in the first place. And you wanna bring up Kyrie? Seriously?

I love Kai. He’s legit one of my favorite players ever and I felt that way before he got to Dallas. But he completely shat all over himself in the Finals. He averaged 14 fucking PPG playing in the Garden in that series when it was supposed to be his revenge series and he was supposed to be the championship vet that doesn’t get rattled by salty fans from a chapter of his career that had closed 5 years beforehand. He arguably somehow had a more embarassing series than Luka. You literally have Celtics fans in r/nba saying this and that it’s hilarious to blame Luka for losing that series but there’s always the few weirdos who want to feel like they’re on the edge for being Nico fans in what is almost universally considered across the entire sports world as the worst trade in basketball history.

You don’t think the 2024 Mavs could have beaten a 2023 Heat or the Pacers or some shit this year? After the 2023 Finals the Nuggets were being talked about as a potential dynasty and immediately crumbled. Boston looked like the 96 Bulls a year ago and are now on the verge of getting knocked out in the second round and are gonna be forced to soft blow it up this year due to financial concerns. Juggernauts rise and fall in the blink of an eye and windows for opportunity open up, *especially* nowadays in this age of parity. that was kind of the entire point of having a 25 year old superstar who would give you bare minimum 5 more years of being in the position to take advantage of those opportunities vs a 33 year old made of glass who will give you at best like 3 more years. Just because they made the Finals once and couldn’t beat the historically dominant team that happened to come out the other side, how is the answer to blow it up? The team got better. You proved you had something there for the next few years with the core of Luka/Kyrie/Lively/PJ/Gafford. Every team that wins a championship has to go through their licks and keep weathering the storm. Boston was in and out of the ECF every year without hoisting jack shit until they hit their peak and things broke their way last year with some injury luck and momentum… imagine if the Celtics blew it up and traded Tatum for old man Kawhi after losing to Golden State in 2022, if Dirk got traded for Shaq in 2006 or 2007.

1. I think we draft 3 Rookies. Our Lotto Pick, The Bucks Pick, and The 2nder.

The Knicks and Rockets picks will be used to move into the 2026 draft class (The Nuggets doesn't have any picks in this class, those could be a trade partner)

  
2. I think it will be all of the above, They will use the cap to pick up a salary dump for assets, placeholder contracts (Dlo) & a Longterm contract (Picking up a FA that will be here post rebuild. Probably Nickeil Alexander-Walker)

  
3. Im predicting Cam will get a 3 year descending contract anywhere between $18-25Ms, Dayron ($5.9) and Ziaire ($8.3) will both get their Qualifying Offer.

  
4. Im 50-50 on both guys. If they do get traded I think Claxton will either be a Laker or Hawk and Cam will be a Spurs.",3,28078.0,1744671420.0,GoNets

It’s not going to any of the teams from the already-stacked West conference, leaving Wizards, Philly, Charlotte, Brooklyn and Toronto. Considering Brooklyn’s solid now in player development, roster construction, draft assets, and still in search for their franchise guy, who else to look forward to other than the 6’9 phenom born 400 miles up north in Maine. They’re not gonna send him to Wizards with Sarr, Philly with Embiid and PG, Charlotte with two franchise guys in Lamelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Toronto might be the closest to Nets in terms of how competitive and developmental the teams were and the potential fit of Flagg and Scottie is intriguing, but my gut strongly leans on the league doing the right thing and sending Flagg to a team that can develop the guy and give him the keys. You think Wemby landed on Spurs purely based on the ping pongs? Either way we can confidently expect the Nets to land a top 3 pick but I’m more confident they might get their guy after all. If a consensus number 1 pick is soon to enter the draft, expect the league to intervene and influence the lottery for protecting the landscape of the league and expect that to be a non franchise star and non-mismanaged org/team (likely Toronto/Brooklyn)",1,8716.0,1746789049.0,GoNets

2026 FRP is a swap

Lakers get 2 young good centers 

Another young defensive player who can play 2-3

An overpaid declining KCP as compensation, he is still good defensively and can find his shot back if Lakers playmakers create good looks for him, if not, he is expiring the year after and can be traded then (he will be more beneficial than Vando I think and shorter contract as well)

Use the TPMLE on a 3-4 or another guard like Exum, find 1-2 good vet mins (or buy a second round pick to try a young player), extend Hayes as 3rd center (or a get vet min Center). Doesn't matter if LeBron opts in or not.

You keep Reaves, in this scenario and you keep your 2031 pick as well, if necessary that can be spent though, try to get a few seconds back in that situation for a smaller trade at the deadline.

Why would Cavs do this: They are getting 5.6m salary relief next season and 11m for the season after. They are getting a very probable trade up in the next draft (their pick is heavily swapped though I don't know how it will work), they can cut Shake and stretch (for more savings next year) and keep Goodwin as the 15th player.

Why would Magic do this: Magic has 4 centers and 2 very big forwards. Banchero and M. Wagner's (their preferred center) extensions are coming next year, they have more extensions the year after. If they don't do anything they will be above the 2nd apron. They also have 4 picks in this draft where they can draft 1 or 2 centers. 

They get rid of KCP's big contract, WCJ's long one as well. 2.7m relief this season and a lot more in the upcoming seaons. They get Knecht and Gabe which can play in positions they desperately need (playmaking and shooting). They no longer need Harris and Joseph, they can reject their TOs (they have younger better alternatives now). Kleber can be a 3rd string stretch big for them (more Germans for them) for a season while they develop their new rookie center. Only negative contract they take over is Vando here, so maybe it is more realistic for Lakers to send its 2031 protected pick and take those 2 seconds.",-6,17536.0,1746801621.0,lakers

\- Will slow the tempo down on all the other scenarios, complementing Luka's game. Luka want to kill you in every possession with cold reads, but adding to his arsenal (pick and roll drives end one, step back threes, slow down in the paint and 2s, and trickshots of any kind) the old time ""post-repost"" we saw couple times with LeBron this year (but imagine that with a strong athletic beast like giannis), it will be game over.

Not many teams would want his contract, and he doesn’t fit the Nets timeline with their rebuild, so they’d look to get some assets from him, with that preference likely being this offseason, since his trade value could decrease if he struggles on their likely bad team next season.

Even without a proper big man, JJ’s schemes allowed us a 3rd seed. We just ran into a matchup that was indispensable without a decent big.

With Ham, we were constantly a Play-In squad. There’s a big difference here. We made the WCF with him once, but that likely had to do with the team’s motivation over Ham actually calling plays.

And even if he *does* become a star, he’ll still be a star you have to hide on defense.

Stacking a strong defensive roster around Reaves and Luka won’t solve the problem. Opposing offenses will still target them relentlessly. We’ll be forced to double, and our defense will stay broken—because with those two on the floor, it’s always 3-on-5 on the defensive end.",12,71905.0,1746745486.0,lakers

It’s been awesome finally seeing a homegrown player after all these years and all the leaps he’s made on the offensive side of the ball. I will continue to support him even if he is traded. 

I can also acknowledge that Lakers now have Luka and having the worst starting defensive backcourt in the league isn’t going to work. Lakers also don’t have many valuable assets. It’s basically AR, DK, 1st round pick and some expiring contracts. We desperately need a center, backup center, and a POA defender. 

I’m not saying trade AR for just anyone. I wouldn’t even put him in a deal for Claxton, Rob should be able to close that without including AR. If trading AR for a top POA defender in the league is possible the deal has to be made no questions asked. 

Also you guys are very high on AR due to his contract. If AR was getting paid 30 mill a year as a traffic cone on defense and also getting shut down offensively for an entire series, you guys would have a much different opinion. So maybe trading him while his value is high, before he gets that big extension is the right move.",8,7080.0,1746746612.0,lakers

Luka showing up in the fourth like he needed to wins us games. Look at brundon these games are low scoring you need a guy to get reliable 2pt buckets late in games.

Luka 2pt % this year and ability to burst past bigs n get those shots is dead n killed us.

The expectation of them fitting together perfectly with very little vertical spacing is simply insane.
