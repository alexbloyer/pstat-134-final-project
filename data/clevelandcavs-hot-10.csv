Highly recommend just getting standard Max subscription for 16.99...all NBA PLAYOFFS, ALL NHL playoffs, righteous gemstones, AEW Live on Wednesday and Collision live on Saturday, French Open in May. Max is where it's at tbh, between the original shows, South park, good movie selection it's definitely worth it at a time where money is tight. 

Super helpful not needing a Sling or Fubo package that's almost triple the cost of Max
