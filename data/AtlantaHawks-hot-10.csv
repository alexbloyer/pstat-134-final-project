mrascqw,red2play,"The league has changed.  Trae is going to have to be able to hold his opponents down for a split second on defense to make any real runs into the playoffs.  They targeted Max Straus when they had Okoro on the bench.  We need more playmakers and so I hope we take Egor Demin, if he's there.  He's a SF/PG that can compliment Trae and take over if he's on the bench and he can play defense.  He gives an extra wing and a defender and a playmaker at 6'9"".

I don't agree with trading for a star, I think that we should continue to construct a team around Trae and if we prove that we can win, we can get stars without giving up the farm.  Fox to the Spurs, Jimmy Butler to GSW, 70% of the players on the Celtics, all prove that if a star wants to play with you, you can have the stars on the cheap.  

Forcing a trade, trying to get stars with picks and players always leaves you gimped while other teams can easily pick up stars.  Just start winning and they will come and be patient.

If Trae decides to leave next year, which I doubt will happen, we just need to continue to improve the roster just like OKC, Rockets, Magic, etc.

Before anyone brings up the Nuggets, they would have easily had a star but they vastly overpaid MPJ.  They in the tax even before any FA would come there and they let KPJ and Bruce Brown Jr because of said contract.

This notion that Trae doesn't have any help is bullshit. For the past three years and I am being generous Trae has been the common denominator but the Hawks fanbase would rather be mediocre than to take a chance on the Hawks going in a different direction organization-wise by resetting the configuration of the FO and by extension the roster.

mraepa8,PeasePorridge9dOld,"Yeah, you can. Without researching, I‚Äôd bet that >> 80% of FA signings are either SnT or through an Exception. Unless you have Max level $$, cap space is generally worthless - even teams below the floor will sometimes act as an above the cap team if they aren‚Äôt chasing the top end of the market. Thing about SnTs is that you are generally trading for the cap space over the player and there are well worn prices for cap space. We have the additional advantage of not actually needing the other team to eat $$ to create the space which should drive down the cost.

I don‚Äôt care about the $$ for picks at 13 & 22. Those picks should be trade fodder if the right player is available. Auburn‚Äôs starting lineup was older than ours. We have enough youth. It‚Äôs time to get some adults in the room.

The combine is next week so that‚Äôs when the rumors should start leaking about what teams could be doing this offseason. Some of the rumors I‚Äôll be tracking
- teams that are looking at tax / apron thresholds. Obviously these are the teams that will be most interested in jettisoning salary and would place the highest value on not taking players back. IND (Nembhard, Toppin, & Neismith), ORL (Anthony, KCP), CLE (Jerome, Hunter - lol), MIN (Reid, NAW). All of them will be traversing new territory and might be a bit cautious.
- Teams that are looking at massive philosophical shifts, typically those transitioning to new leadership. SAC (Malik Monk)is the one that I‚Äôm looking at directly but other trans such as DEN, PHI, NOP, MIL, CHAR, LAL, and PHX could try to pull off something massive that could involve several teams each with a small part. Those are always fun.
- Last is the FA market and SnTs. These are trickier since we can‚Äôt include our picks this year in a package for them without getting investigated. Looking if teams are having productive conversations with their FAs or are we seeing some with roving eyes. Specifically have eyes on Santi Aldama and Naz Reid. Will also track Kuminga. Other could come up here too.",1,16687,1746728953.0,AtlantaHawks

mrb6h95,TerrorizingThunder,"A team can use their trade exception to acquire a FA via sign & trade yes. However they can‚Äôt sign a FA outright with money from a trade exception is what I‚Äôm saying. Monk would be a nice addition, but it would probably take #22 to acquire him. Also with LeVert likely to resign & ya‚Äôll sending picks for Mann it‚Äôs probably better to keep #22, sign Tyus, & land  Toppin for three 2nds because he provides needed front court depth with Capela likely leaving. 

Aldama & Reid will resign with their respective teams in my opinion. No need for Kuminga when Johnson, who is better, is already there. That would just end up being a bad contract. I believe this plan of mine here is a realistic offseason plan.",2,250,1746737157.0,AtlantaHawks

mrbwuz0,PeasePorridge9dOld,"... and what I'm saying is that maybe 4-5 players out of dozens or even 100's of FAs are signed with pure cap space in an off-season so why does it matter. It doesn't have much impact on signing an FA so why even continue to bring it up? 

I'd do Monk for 22. You're wildly overrating 22, especially in this draft. Already said the roster is too youth heavy so having less picks would be a good thing in my book. If they kicked in Ellis, then I'd hand over 13 instead - assuming we can navigate the contract.

Iffy on Toppin. I wouldn't mind acquiring him but idk if I'd burn the burn entire DJ TPE on just him. If he came with Nesmith then I'm sure something could be worked out. Would prefer to not hand over multiple 2nds in future years; Landry left the cupboard bare there and we need to restock. Would consider dropping from 13 to 23 for the right package.  
  
I'm fine on Tyus, but he feels more like a final piece than a centerpiece of the off-season. idk if he can play alongside Trae ala someone like Monk. Monk has proven off ball ability, but Tyus has always been ball in hand. Think we could get more defensively out of Monk too (albeit a very low bar). 

I suspect Reid and Aldama will be returning as well but both of their teams are about to have to make some hard decisions in regards to salary. Would be worth it to force both teams to take out the checkbook and at least match on $25M. No agent worth his salt would let the team just deny the SnT for no one and still play hard ball.

Kuminga is basically the worst centerpiece I could see us getting and still thinking we had even a semi-successful off-season. Neither F position has a backup so there's plenty of minutes for the taking. The fact that we've got no creator after Trae means that we have a lot of opportunity to sell. Would he come in on a 2 + 1 if he can compete for the keys to the O for 10-15 minutes/night? I'm sure that answer would depend on the other bidders too...",1,16687,1746745876.0,AtlantaHawks

mr5e8pd,dillpickles007,That's also why it's sometimes smarter to get a deal done early.  Bet the Mavs wish they'd locked Brunson up a season before they tried to.,5,215735,1746657929.0,AtlantaHawks

mr4sm57,amidon1130,Try 5/125 and we‚Äôll see if he even takes it lol. Cap has blown up and elite role players come at a premium,3,237620,1746651164.0,AtlantaHawks

mr6w0td,PeasePorridge9dOld,"We gave Jalen $30M / year for 1 season. Suggs wasn‚Äôt looking too hot going into his 3rd year too.

If we use Suggs as the basis then I would be fine with that. Especially if we can get Dyson on a declining deal like Suggs‚Äô.",3,16687,1746677484.0,AtlantaHawks
mr992or,Bry_Mac,"You match anything offered. Done.

Had Jalen not signed his team friendly deal, I would have done the same.",2,13034,1746716880.0,AtlantaHawks
mr4xt6k,Josh378,Yep. I just don't think he's worth 25 to 30 million a year right now. That would put him on the borderline all-star pay grade.,5,12151,1746652647.0,AtlantaHawks

mr8o7yf,IveGotsTheRemedi,Jalen has a much more complete offensive game than Dyson. Dyson is still a 60% FT shooter which raises a lot of questions on his shooting.,1,1075,1746710453.0,AtlantaHawks
mr6n6qs,_QazzaQ,You‚Äòre really underestimating the cap increase. 25 million is not close to all star money. There are 75 players are projected to make 25M or more next season and Dyson‚Äôs contract will not start for another season,3,3432,1746673723.0,AtlantaHawks

mr4rnmn,Patekchrono917,The full non tax payer MLE is 14 million this year. The cap has increased a bunch the last few years. Even more than it has been.¬†,8,19334,1746650894.0,AtlantaHawks
mrbxfdy,PeasePorridge9dOld,"Don't disagree, but let's not move the goalposts. Jalen is simply an example of a player we gave $30M after 1 season of production. So that hasn't stopped us before, why should it stop us now?

Suggs is still the comp for Dyson in terms of the deal. Suggs is/was the better shooter in his 1 successful year before his extension, but it isn't like he didn't turn back into a pumpkin when he was on the court this year. Meanwhile, Dyson had more rebounds, assists, points, steals, and blocks.",1,16687,1746746076.0,AtlantaHawks
mr4tdvg,MadMonkeh,Ah gotcha. It‚Äôs been hard to keep up with contracts and whatnot and cap increases with *looks around America* everything else going on,5,3386,1746651377.0,AtlantaHawks
