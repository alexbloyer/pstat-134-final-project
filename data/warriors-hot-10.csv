Reasons for optimism

* Good to see JK play well, could use a punch of scoring off the bench if we want to steal a game. He did well to leak out early before Gobert gets sets [like he does here](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/384/630e7b79-8144-7c6a-ac7e-2251f10ebca5_1280x720.mp4). [Pushing off made buckets is huge too](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/333/e1663cf6-0676-626a-20d4-b879944f613f_1280x720.mp4).

* Might be a real chance for TJD to contribute. Similar to how Gafford/Lively found space behind Gobert for lobs last year, [TJD did much of the same](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/277/7af91fe0-f02f-3ba8-4c51-d1ae8283e515_1280x720.mp4). The 4-5 P&R [here was super cool too](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/491/311cdd0d-89c7-1696-0f22-b9712884fd4a_1280x720.mp4).

* Don't have clips, but thought Dray's been really on it on both ends of the court. The defense has been amazing this series, mucking up drives, quarterbacking the backline, timely switches. Offensively, I think he's found the right level of aggression (unlike the Houston series). The shots will hopefully fall, but this is the level of aggression we'll need from Dray if we need steal a game.

One big reason for pessimism

* The half-court creation remains a huge worry. [Jimmy can't get anything against Gobert](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/400/5f67f678-5a54-205c-1a2a-59f6abd0530d_1280x720.mp4), Buddy takes a grenade. [Jimmy/GP screen gets nothing](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/469/6ddd664a-e8e2-fade-e751-adb6cd2d77ea_1280x720.mp4), grenade for Moses. JK/Podz high screen another nothing, [another Buddard grenade](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2025/05/08/0042400232/621/011064cf-48d6-543b-35ea-d6afd37c2729_1280x720.mp4).

Human nature is what it is, and I'm sure when Minny was up 20 or whatever, they entered cruise control mode. I know people are faulting kerr for making the subs during the run, but it's very likely Minny would've punched back regardless. When they decided to turn up on offense, it was easy for them (3 pt defense was noticeably worse last night). Maybe stating the obvious, but I don't think we can expect the same playoff Jimmy. He's hurt, he's older, and he's carrying a heavier load (those Miami teams weren't bereft of offensive contributors). But damn, he needs to stop driving in, stopping and looking around to pass out to someone who then has no idea what to do. 

My only hope is that JK and TJD seem like they could be actual contributors in this series. I think Pat has shown his limitations in actual meaningful minutes.

They have so much that's wrong with their offense, starting with two non shooters in randle and gobert, and two dudes in ant and randle who are clearly at their best when they're allowed to go 1v1 iso ball, which by the way, has a tendency to ice out players because they're never involved and never in rhythm. ¬†Against a smart team like the dubs, coached by kerr who is so good at attacking teams' weaknesses, this is a bad matchup for them. Defensively, they have 3 big dudes in mcdaniels, randle and gobert. Great for front line d, but vs smaller quicker warrior players, they cant keep up. Mcdaniels is great vs bigger slower players like reaves, luka, rui, and lebron, but vs steph, jimmy, buddy, podz, etc, he's good, just not great. They have size, but dubs are used to winning against teams with size. Nothing new to them. They outrebounded them in gm1 for instance. Got 6 more offensive boards than the wolves. Gobert as a rebounder is not close to steven adams, who was the rocket's offensive rebounding lifeline with all their misses.

Fans dismiss this readily (even dubs fans), but the team went 3-1 vs the wolves in the regular season for a reason. People are quick to point out that it was because randle was still being integrated. The truth is, it's just a bad matchup for them. Dubs play too fast for them and the bbiq is not what they're used to",2,3670.0,1746812396.0,warriors

As to why it happens like that? I¬†honestly think it's because kerr never has any plans to run the offense thru him. With kerr's offense, seems like everything has to be in sync and everyone has to have a role around the main ball handler, who is usually curry/dray/jimmy. So when things break down, and jk decides to take matters into his own hands, guys are probably like, ""wtf?"". They then end up just standing around not sure what to do maybe. Or maybe they're secretly annoyed that he's doing that. Probably explains why kerr benched jk at the end of the reg season? He probably didnt wanna put up with that style of play in crucial games where margin of error is zero

mrd06ax,DrewDan96,"expected the L, that said, we're down 7 and fast breaking with the ball, then Jimmy gifts them the ball back and they never look back, so maybe there was a slight chance to be greedy and take 2, but a split without the Chef is a fair result

that said, there's too many shook ones on the team right now. guys accustomed to PASSING instead of FINISHING/SHOOTING the damn ball. Moses Moody. GPII, etc. Podz going to the rim. if you're going to the rim, go to the rim WITH FORCE. no pausing, no passing out at the last second. ditto for the perimeter ""shooters"", guys get the ball with a brief moment of openness, pause looking to pass, and the moment is gone and the whole action is reset to zero - we then end up with bad desperation shots at the end of the 24-sec clock. that can't fly. btw now and Saturday all these guys need to put up AT LEAST 500 threes, get some kind of feel for shooting, and shooting it in one fluid motion regardless of if the defender is recovering to him

i don't think Minnesota so far looks as tough as Houston defensively, but right now we don't have enough offense to stay with them. i hope Kuminga/TJD get more PT, we're going to need both. right now Post/Moody might need to sit unless they're more effective. it's a small thing but i really didn't like seeing Steph on the bench, sitting/standing like that, i want that guy IMMOBILIZED lol with like Himalayan flower sap slathered on his hammy while like 2 room-sized machines are hooked up to it just rejuvenating it 24/7 like the damn DBZ meme lol. at least be in a wheelchair or SOMETHING Steph lol

1. Kuminga needs more minutes. He was probably the lone bright spot on offense. He looked good

2. Moody isn‚Äôt playable. Dude is a black hole on offense and defense. If a 3 and D guy isn‚Äôt doing either, he‚Äôs gotta stop getting minutes. 

3. Podz needs to focus on facilitating. His shot isn‚Äôt falling at all. Focus on getting lobs to TJD/Kuminga, and finding Buddy open looks. take some pressure off Butler as a ball handler. 

4. TJD opens up lobs on offense which can be big if we can keep playing Gobert off the floor. Downside is he was a sieve on defense for the most part. 

5. Draymond idk man keep it in check, you can‚Äôt be the leader of the team if you can‚Äôt stay on the floor because of your temper.

5. Pat Spencer ain‚Äôt it. Love the hype, but he was bad. Can‚Äôt shoot, couldn‚Äôt finish.

Jimmy has to step up. I know he has some injuries but he has done it before. If he's gonna play passive, then just take the days off man and punt the whole game. It's not reallt about being hurt if you pass up a layup against Donte on a fastbreak.

Moody has been trash since the playoffs except garbage minutes. Dude feels so lost. 

Podz has to wake up as well.

Spencer's minutes should be cut. Dude gets blown by everyone.

Draymond has to control his emotions. They arent blown up by 50 because of him. He has been their best player this series all bec of his defense. As long as he doesnt get ejected they are fine.

Some positives
- TJD is effective against this lineup most esp when Gobert is off the floor. 
- Kuminga may be the source of points. Just need to find the right combination to surround him. 
- The Wolves are bad screen navigators and they are so confused with all the cutting. They are definitely a mediocre defensive team against all these movements.

in terms of the loss, it's fine that we lost, but I just think we could've had a better fight. why did we run a lineup with no Jimmy/Draymond in the 2nd against their 1st/2nd unit mix? we barely scored bc nobody knew what to do, and defense was non-existent. what's worse is that we brought the game back to within 7 only for kerr to take that lineup out and play the bench again. we had a chance to make a run and actually see if that lineup can win/hold up when the wolves gassed up again, why don't we play our guys? why don't we try to win (or even give up in the 4th if it doesn't work)? i get that experimenting is a thing, but experimenting with spencer? with santos? why bother experimenting players/lineups that we'd NEVER even would see in the playoffs if steph was healthy?",1,1476.0,1746767583.0,warriors

My response as a T-Wolves fan is this... The wolves have been playing pretty bad. Game 1 might have been the worst I've ever seen this seem play, and was maybe the worst shooting game they've ever had. Game 2 was slightly better, but still below average performance from them. ANT has been missing so many easy layups he usually always hits. 

But another thing to factor is that they are also like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates, you never know what team is going to show up. They can blow out a contending team by 30 if they are clicking, or they can lose to a bottom dwelling team. 

So if there's anything the opposing fan base should be worried about, is if they click for a few games. But there's no guarantee of that happening.",1,29375.0,1746789860.0,warriors

Got a migraine at Oracle and couldn‚Äôt hear right for a day or so. My whole head felt like it was in a fishbowl. LOUD. 

Got none of that at Chase. Listened to a BBC podcast on the way home last weekend and could hear every word of the hosts mumbling quietly about British politics. That would have been impossible if that game had been played at Oracle, because my hearing would have been blown out.

At Oracle, the crowd was going when two conditions were met: (1) the game clock was going and (2) the Warriors had the ball. That was it. At Chase, people only cheered when someone scored. They didn‚Äôt cheer the actual offensive or defensive play, which I found odd. (Why the hell else would you go to the game?)

He gets upset when an opponent gets the better of him.  This could be on a single play like stripping him blocking him, or just outplaying him over the course of a game.  He can also get upset when the team is losing even if he is more or less playing ok.

What he does is he looks to get a free dirty shot on a player and acts like it was a natural motion.  The worst part is that Dubs fans, including myself at times, pretend along with Draymond that it was an accident or a normal basketball move.  That's bullshit, and we know it.
