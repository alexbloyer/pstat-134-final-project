mrgrg1v,ok-milk,"If we had one bucket-getter that could also play D, I think our season would have ended later.  On that we can agree.  Having one good shooter creates double-teams and mismatches and changes the whole dynamic of the offense.


My issue with Fred is that he didn't really create opportunities and he wasn't an especially great passer.  It seemed like all the backdoor passes were made by our wings, and I don't think I ever saw him run a P&R with Sengun.   So we are we getting for our $40mm?


I think he did put up hard shots, and he did calm down the young players when it got hairy.  And if I am being fair, he found another gear in the playoffs, but not to the extent that I thought he could carry the team.  He just bricked less.

mrgu15u,TheHeardTheorem,I 100% agree! I was just telling a friend last night that I could see Amen as being considered the greatest combination of athleticism and BBIQ the game has seen by the end of his career if he hits his ceiling. Most guys with insane athleticism are able to get by on that alone and don’t typically wind up with the mental makeup for greatness because all they’ve had to do is out-athlete everyone else their entire lives.

mrdd657,Teambooler24," Couldn’t agree more, these are my thoughts, sorry may be long 

One, booker had a “down” year and had 26,7,4, one of the reasons his shooting splits and stuff is down is because due to the suns really poor roster he had to play an out of position at point guard, I know they had tyus but tyus literally was just a spot up shooter, Devin Booker was initiating the offense and being the primary playmaker which he has become good at but not what makes him elite 

What makes Devin Booker elite is as on off scorer, he’s one the best in the world off the catch and using movement, whether that’s coming off a dribble handoff into a one dribble pull off, working off down screens and pin downs and similar actions he’s one of the absolute best, and one of the best half court shot creators in all of basketball 

If he was in Houston we use a heavy dribble handoff offense, you’d utilize booker and sengun similar to how Murray and jokic work, Booker plays better as a true shooting guard when you have a point guard that can set up things, which is what Fred will do ( I’d bring him back on a deal around 25-30 mil ) and that will allow amen to ease into that point forward role with little pressure as he blossoms into the alpha superstar I believe he will be, amens cutting helps booker a ton and bookers gravity on off ball actions gives amen more room to drive, and senguns playmaking as a center helps even more 

When the suns inevitably call for Durant, everytime I low ball the hell out of them, and when they counter decline, but say “ if you offer booker we have Jalen, cam, tari or Bari and your picks “ you hope that the package they get for Durant is so bad booker just doesn’t see a path for them to retool and they trade him 

I know seeing tari or Bari, not both, in the trade is a lot for some people but we will have to trade one to stay under the second apron in a few years anyways, so we need to consolidate, and use the roster spot on a good value 3 point shooter that hopefully can defend and on good value 

Go into next year with Fred/booker/amen/brooks/sengun
Reed/3 and d guy/ tari or bari/adams, and additional depth to fill out the roster, that team is ready to compete imo ",4,15957,1746766703.0,rockets

* It means you can keep two of Amen/Booker/Sengun out on the floor at all times, which would significantly improve our offense over the course of an entire game.
* More playmakers also just makes your offense more unpredictable and harder to stop as multiple players can score and create for others.
* Booker is also a great off-ball player who you can run off-ball screens for to get his shots, so that allows you to keep the ball in Amen and Sengun's hands more during those actions.
* I also think Booker could make a very nice two-man game with Sengun similar to Murray/Jokic. You need a smart playmaker for that type of two man game who can hit tough jumpers, and that fits Booker perfectly. I can't imagine Jaylen being able to play off Sengun well like that.

I'm sure Jaylen would be good as well, but I always prefer offensive options who have the ability to score and playmake at a high level as I think those guys are much more difficult to shut out of a game.",3,64350,1746802528.0,rockets
