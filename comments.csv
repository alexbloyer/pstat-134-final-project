ku7fupy,ImpressionWitty6410,"Forgive my candar, but why are you doing this? You have very specific times you are trying to get him to vacate your shared home. Is this because you and your man want to  get freaky while he is gone. If I were your roommate and I found out you were trying to hook me up with random women online for whatever reason , you want the place to yourself,  I would be pissed. First, unless he gave you a green light to do this, which I am guessing he didn't because if he wanted to get a date in this fashion, he is capable of doing it himself. , and if he did not give you the ok to do this. Frankly  you are a very presumptuous person to assume  it is your business or your right to insert yourself in his private dating life, so you can get him out of the house for whatever you plan to do.  Unless he directly asked for your help, you're being very rude and inappropriate.  If you need time alone in your place, ask Jim directly or find a roomy better suited to your personal needs. But making his business your business, especially with the alterior motive of benefiting yourself. That's a narcissistic way of doing things because you think everything is about what's best for you, even if it's none of your business  and you don't respect his boundaries.  With all due respect, I would suggest you keep your eyes on your own paper and keep your arrogance in check.  In my opinion, this is way out of bounds, and you may even endanger your living situation snd friendship. He is a grown man he can look for a female on his own when he is good and ready.  It's not your business to make him ready so you can serve your own selfish needs. Respect your roommates' privacy and autonomy.

ku71raw,MaxRideout,"My suggestion if you're really committed to helping him in this regard would be to get him to cut out that insufferable high-school boy stuff - learn to train properly in the gym (if he's going that often and doing it right, it should be noticeable), broaden his activities beyond LoL, and most of all cut out the stoner BS and do some introspection about why he leans on that crutch and what his priorities and values truly are. The best way to improve his chance to be with others is for him to improve himself, especially if he wants to be in a mutually beneficial and healthy relationship, not just with someone who'll enable him to avoid personal growth.

(Also, brushing that often every day is just hard on your teeth and gums. If that much brushing feels necessary, it'd be better to figure out and correct what's causing it to feel necessary - perhaps the copius weed intake and presumably significant consumption of unhealthy snacks?)",1,1710059405.0,t3_1b8p9zk,t3_1b8p9zk,/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1b8p9zk/looking_for_someone_to_date_my_roommate_please/ku71raw/,False,,False

Is this psychosocial ""experiment"" part of a greater effort to understand the effects of long-term close confinement as it may relate to mass interstellar travel? I mean, current data suggests young, healthy volunteers adjust more or less functionally to the loss of natural daylight and cramped quarters as experienced on the ISS. Volunteers, whose tour of duty is heavily monitored and alleviated by their respective space agencies.

I guess it's important to eliminate the self-selection bias inherent in astronauts and take it ""to the streets"" to find out what percent of 4,500 randomized to the Munger quarters are suitable for long-haul service aboard the *Nostromo*.

The words Human and Mankind, derive from the Latin word humanus, which is gender neutral and means ""people of earth"".
It's a mix of the words Humus (meaning earth) and Homo (gender neutral, meaning Human or People).
Thus words like Fireman, Policeman, Human, Mankind, etc are not sexist in of it self.
The only sexism you will find here is the one you yourself look upon the world with.
